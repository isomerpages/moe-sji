The Direct School Admission (DSA) is a scheme which gives SJI the flexibility to select students for admission based on a recognition of more diverse range of achievements and talents than just results achieved at national examinations. SJI offers DSA into the following levels:

*   [**DSA to Year 1 (OP/IP)**](/admission/dsa-at-sji/direct-school-admission-to-year-1-in-2023) \- boys-only secondary school

*   [**DSA to Year 5 (IBDP)**](/admission/dsa-at-sji/direct-school-admission-to-year-5-jc1-in-2023) \- co-education junior college
