##### MOE’s School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS)

  

SPERS-Sec is a centralised posting exercise conducted at the end of the year, usually sometime in October, for Returning Singaporeans who wish to join secondary schools at Sec 1, Sec 2 and Sec 3 at the beginning of the next academic year.  
  
Based on the applicant's SPERS results, the applicant will be given a list of schools that he will be eligible for. The applicant will get to indicate his 6 school choices from the eligible list, and then MOE will post the applicant into a secondary school based on merit, vis-a-vis his school choices and available vacancies.
