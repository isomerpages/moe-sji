**<u>SJI is an all-boys-only secondary school</u>** for both O-Level and Integrated Programmes.

#### • Admission Criteria For Secondary 1

Primary 6 boys are admitted into Secondary 1 at SJI [based on the merit of their PSLE scores](/admission/o-level-n-integrated-programme/entry-into-secondary-1#_ptod_42388). Those with talents in sports, arts or innovation can apply to be admitted via [Direct School Admission (DSA)](/admission/o-level-n-integrated-programme/entry-into-secondary-1#_ptod_42389).

  

Those who are unsuccessful in gaining admission based on their PSLE score may [appeal](/admission/o-level-n-integrated-programme/entry-into-secondary-1#_ptod_42390) for a place at SJI if there are vacancies. Applicants appealing for admission to SJI **MUST meet the cut-off point (COP) of the particular programme**.

  

**Unless there are exceptional circumstances, we do not admit boys into Secondary 1 who have not sat for the PSLE examinations or [SPERS-Sec](http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/admissions/spers-sec/)**.

  

For more details, please see [**Entry Into Secondary 1**](/admission/o-level-n-integrated-programme/entry-into-secondary-1).

#### • Admission To Integrated Programme Secondary 3

The SJI Integrated Programme (IP) Secondary 3 is open for application to boys in Secondary 2 who are currently in the O-level programme and are NOT admitted to their current secondary school (other than SJI), via the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise.

  

For more details, please see **[Admission To Integrated Programme Secondary 3](/admission/o-level-n-integrated-programme/admission-to-integrated-programme-secondary-3-in-ay2023).**

#### • Transfer from Another Singapore School

Local students (boys only) wishing to transfer to SJI at Secondary 2 or 3 are required to sit for an SJI Entrance Test.

  

**Unless there are exceptional circumstances, we do not accept any transfer of students into Secondary 4 as the 10 months duration available would not be sufficient time for the school to prepare the students admitted adequately for the GCE 'O' level examinations.**

  

There is no vacancy for Sec 2 & 3 OP track in 2020.

#### • Returning Singaporeans

Returning Singaporeans (boys only) who would like to join secondary schools at Secondary 1, Secondary 2, and Secondary 3 at the beginning of the next academic year are to register for the MOE [**SPERS-Sec**](http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/admissions/spers-sec/). The advantage of registering for the MOE [**SPERS-Sec**](http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/admissions/spers-sec/) is that the results could be used to gain admission into the best available secondary school in order of merit that has a vacancy without the need for further testing by the school.

Alternatively, boys who would like to seek admission into SJI at Secondary 2 or Secondary 3 at the beginning of the next academic year can also consider sitting for an SJI Entrance Test. Those who would like to seek admission into SJI at Secondary 1 are advised to sit for the [**SPERS-Sec**](http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/admissions/spers-sec/) and use the SPERS-Sec results to gain admission.
