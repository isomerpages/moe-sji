• School Songs
--------------

At SJI, staff and students bond through song on the first day of school. With songs, Josephians bring to life through music a history of togetherness in the school.

The **School Rally** is steeped in history. The music is adapted from O'Donnell Aboo in 1597, and the lyrics were written by Brother Marcian James Cullen (1869-1938). The **St Joseph’s Call** is an adaptation of Ireland’s Call (a song commissioned by the Irish Rugby Football Union for use at international Rugby Union fixtures). SJI also received permission from Mr Phil Couter, who gave his permission to use the song. In 2005, St Joseph's Call made it into the school diary as a tribute to the contributions of the Irish Brothers.

#### The School Rally

**Music: O’Donnell Aboo, 1597<br>
Lyrics by Brother Marcian James Cullen (1869-1938)**

  

All through our college, a voice is resounding,  
Promptly respond to your duty’s sweet call.  
Harken you all for the trumpet is sounding,  
Your Mater’s proclaiming her watchword to all.

**<u>Chorus</u>**

**_Forward her children dear,  
ever with hearts sincere,  
Render with joy to your Mater her due.  
All that is vile reject, heaven will e’er protect  
Sons of St Joseph’s valiant and true_**

Onward and upward in life’s earnest battle,  
Joyously bearing the brunt of the fight  
Nobly forgiving, for all that may pain you,  
And bravely defending the cause of the right.

**_Forward her children dear,  
ever with hearts sincere,  
Render with joy to your Mater her due.  
All that is vile reject, heaven will e’er protect  
Sons of St Joseph’s valiant and true_**

"Ora et Labora" your motto still bearing,  
Forward with courage in ways that are just,  
True to your standard, be serving and daring,  
As faithful Josephians, in heaven you trust.

#### St. Joseph's Call

Come the day and come the hour  
Come the power and the glory  
We have come to answer  
Our Mater’s call  
To uphold the glory of St Joseph's

<u>Chorus</u>

**_St Joseph’s, St Joseph’s  
Together standing tall  
Shoulder to shoulder  
We’ll heed St Joseph’s call_**

From the flaming red of Michael  
To the yellow burst of Lawrence  
From the green of Marcian  
And Fintan blue  
To uphold the glory of St Joseph's

**_St Joseph’s, St Joseph’s  
Together standing tall  
Shoulder to shoulder  
We’ll heed St Joseph’s call_**

Hearts of steel  
And heads unbowing  
Vowing never to be broken  
We will fight, until we  
Can fight no more  
To uphold the glory of St Joseph's

**_St Joseph’s, St Joseph’s  
Together standing tall  
Shoulder to shoulder  
We’ll heed St Joseph’s call_**

**(Roan Cruz)**

  
Hail! Hail Alma Mater. Hail to S - J - I  
We’ll hold your banner high with pride,

We’ll fight to keep your glory bright,  
And never shall we fail.

#### The 125th Anniversary Song

**(R W Mosbergen)**

  

Josephians salute your Alma Mater,  
she reigns majestically fair.  
A landmark in our Lion City.  
A symbol of the brave and true.

A century or more of history,  
she proudly boasts her heritage  
Our hearts glow as we gaze in wonder,  
At the source of our faith and fame,  
At the sound of her glorious name.

Sil’vry dome in the sunshine  
Outstretch’d wings reach out warmly.  
There within her portals,  
We’ve forged our destiny

Steadfast through the decades,  
Always undismayed.  
Rise to her great motto  
It’s simply work and pray.
