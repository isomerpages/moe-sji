**1852**: Six Brothers, in the footsteps of their founder, St John Baptist de La Salle, arrived from Europe to provide for the educational needs of the poor in Singapore. This was to be the first missionary establishment of the La Salle Brothers in the Far East.

It was Reverend Father Jean-Marie Beurel, MEP who initiated the whole endeavour and offered a former chapel for the Brothers to run their school. Within a year an attap hut had to be erected to accommodate the overflow from the former chapel. On 22 July 1852, St. John's School, as SJI was called then, started as a free school at Bras Basah Road which depended on the support of the public.

* * *

  

**1855**: As the number of students wanting enrolment in St John’s School (as it was formerly known) increased, the cornerstone of the expansion was laid on the Feast of St Joseph which was on 19 March. From this date, the School was named St Joseph’s Institution.

* * *

  

**1865**: A Central Classroom Block was built under the guiding hand of Bro Lothaire but the continuing years of expansion before World War I was largely the work of Bro Michael Noctor and Rev Fr Charles Nain (the assistant parish priest at the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd and also a gifted architect).

Father Nain designed two very imaginative classroom blocks. He curved the new wings outwards and at each end designed a monumental doorway. The whole work was reminiscent of Bernini’s Colonnade in front of St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. The work was completed under Bro Michael in 1903.

Amongst the first visitors to the new building was Sir Frank Swettenham - the Governor of the Straits Colony and High Commissioner of the Federated Malay States. (Later visitors to SJI were to include Rabindranath Tagore in 1922 and Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in 1967).

* * *

  

**1905**: Perhaps, more impressive than the building was the fact that SJI was soon to groom some of the recipients of the most glittering academic prizes to be won in the colony. This was the coveted Queen’s Scholarship. Both awards were won by Josephians.

* * *

  

**1906**: The top award went to a Josephian, again, and the second to a boy from St Xavier’s Institution - a La Salle School in Penang.

* * *

  

**1914**: The enrolment of St Joseph’s had reached almost 1,200 in comparison with 426 in 1900.

* * *

  

**1922**: The enrolment figure increased to 1,600.

**1933**: The Brothers could foresee that the enrolment would continue to increase and hence opened a temporary Branch School that eventually led to the building of a new school, St Patrick’s. In World War II, just before the surrender to the Japanese the school was used as a Red Cross Hospital and also housed a unit of the Civil Defence Force, the A.R.F. (Air Raid Precautionary Group). The old building was blessed to remain unscratched despite heavy bombings preceding the surrender on 16 Feb 1942.

In fact, a bomb did hit the school courtyard, the crater of which was still discernible in 1992.

During the Japanese Occupation, the school was renamed Bras Basah Road Boys’ School. The Brothers were soon asked to ‘resign’. The school and hostel were run along military lines. However, after the Japanese Surrender, the Brothers returned and just three weeks later, St Joseph’s was re-opened and normal lessons resumed.

The years after World War II saw St Joseph’s consolidating herself and building upon the good she had done.

**1952**: "In due course, the Centenary arrived and the school celebrated it thoroughly. There were numerous events - a solemn Mass by the pupils of the combined Brothers Schools, at which the Celebrant and his assistants were all old boys; a solemn requiem mass for all departed teachers and pupils of SJI and the other Brothers Schools; a combined Sports Day, a combined Schools concert and a banquet given by the old boys." _From Memories of SJI_

**Unveiling of the SJI 170th Anniversary logo at the Thanksgiving Assembly on 29 Oct 2021**:  

<img src="/images/170anniv_logotype_vector1.png"  
style="width:45%">

The SJI 170th Anniversary logo is designed by Le Hai Long Quan (MN403, Class of 2021) where he aspires to remind Josephians of the Lasallian values of Faith, Service, and Community. Central to the design is the Star of Faith, in Latin “Signum Fidei”. The star is a symbol that guides Josephians through their successes and challenges in life, all of which is part of God’s greater plan. The statue of St John Baptist de La Salle inspires all of us who are part of the educational mission in SJI. It is a reminder of the importance of Service, to always give back to those who have less, especially the poor. A well-intended depiction of human silhouettes is illustrated as four sets of windows, representing the 4 Fraternities of Fintan, Lawrence, Michael and Marcian, which form the SJI Community, a family to which all of us belong.
