The Lasallian School is a Catholic school which operates according to the Lasallian vision and mission of education. The vision and mission are expressed as follows:

*   through worship, reflection and prayer,
*   the religious education programme,
*   integration of Catholic understanding and practice of all elements of the curriculum and school community life,
*   the display of religious art and symbols, and
*   the integration of Lasallian philosophy and practice into the operation of the school.

  

The pastoral care and development of students in a Lasallian school are directed by a perception of students as being, in De La Salle's terms, "disciples". At the heart of the Lasallian School is a deep regard for the inherent dignity of each member of the school community, especially the students and of the teacher-student relationship which is expressed in terms of sisterhood-brotherhood. This underpins an understanding of the causes of behaviour which is respectful of each person and their circumstance.

The curriculum of the Lasallian School is overtly religious, inclusive, planned, practical and contemporary. The curriculum emphasizes excellence in all its dimensions and is directed to the acceptance of civic responsibility. The specific emphasis within the curriculum is determined by the inherent needs and cultural circumstances of the school community. The curriculum caters for specific individual needs, especially for students considered most 'at risk".

The Lasallian School recognizes that teachers are the prime agents in the student's school-based learning when their teaching practice is focussed on:

*   Student learning
*   Effective communication
*   Respect
*   Knowledge of the subject and sound teaching and learning theory
*   Holding high expectations of their students
*   Giving praise more readily and more often than correction
*   Holding the individual student in high regard and acting as a role model for the students - both as learners and as Christians

The Lasallian School adopts a model of human resources and management which is collaborative and consultative based on the principle of delegated authority, mutual respect and oriented to the service of others. It is a community based model which engages and enables regular communication with the families it serves and consequently, allocates resources to meet the prevailing needs as best it is able.

The financial and propery management of the Lasallian School operates according to the values of Christian stewardship i.e. a recognition of the implications of "gratuity", the sharing of resources, simiplicity, the common good and in compliance with the prevailing Church, Lasallian Institute and State authorities.

St. John Baptist de La Salle was recognized as a communitarian in all aspects of his life - with the Brothers, the Christian Schools of the Brothers and his challenges with Church and State Authoriites. Just as the Lasallian School aims to provide a quality human and Christian education, it must also be a quality community characterised by the Christian virtues of caring for each other, other communities and the environment.

**Editorial Note:** As expressed above, SJI is an **inclusive** school and we welcome but do not require non-Catholic teachers and students to participate in any of the religious practices or to hold Catholic beliefs as a basis for admission into the school. We make every effort to organize school activities in such a manner to include teachers and students who share a different faith expression or who do not follow any specific faith expression to participate and benefit from a Josephian education. However, if non-Catholic teachers and students choose to opt out of the Catholic practices/beliefs during common activities such as morning assembly, the school only expects them either to reflect in their own way or to maintain a respectful silence while others are participating in the practices/beliefs.
