SJI IP adopts a process-oriented pedagogical approach so that students will ‘Learn How to Learn’, to become autonomous life-long learners. The pedagogical focus will be on the development of students’ ability to acquire the necessary learning skills and dispositions which would enable them to create new knowledge, rather than just to acquire knowledge and skills for the mere purpose of doing well in examinations.

  

In helping students learn how to become effective learners, the pedagogy will help students to realistically evaluate and regulate their own learning and performance. It will also nurture their affective and cognitive competencies such as to reflect, be self-confident, be self-aware, to be willing to communicate ideas without fear or losing face, to be willing to take risks and be open-minded.

  

Learning in the SJI IP will focus on meaningful questions and authentic contexts, which will engage and challenge the learner’s existing mental models in order to develop deep understanding. The learning will be enhanced through the use of technology. <u>Students will be expected to learn using their own personal computing device in class and in school\*</u>.

  

SJI IP T&L encompasses the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy: Approaches to Learning (ATL) skills along with the six Approaches to Teaching (ATT) aim at developing Josephians to gain conceptual understanding and inter-disciplinary transferable knowledge. It also enables students to “learn how to learn” and is applied across curriculum requirements and provide a common language for teachers and students to use when reflecting and building on the process of learning.

  

\* Students on the IP will be expected to purchase a low cost personal computing device. Students on financial assistance will be helped in the purchase of the low cost personal computing device.
