The Fullerton-SJI Leadership Lectures, since their inauguration in 2010, showcase the views of various distinguished alumni of SJI, all of whom have had a major impact on Singapore and Singaporeans. At each lecture, the Josephian will share his experiences, in particular those leadership moments from which the audience will be able to draw lessons on the art of leadership and grow in awareness of the key considerations in the decision-making process.

  

The inaugural series of Fullerton-SJI Leadership Lectures which took place over two years (2010-2011) featured eight accomplished SJI Old Boys who had played key roles in significant developments/events which had major impact on Singapore and Singaporeans. They openly shared their experiences, including mistakes they had made and what they had learnt from their respective leadership moments. The speakers were: George Yeo, Philip Yeo, Lim Chee Onn, Dick Lee, Gerard Ee, Peter Seah, Tan Chorh Chuan and Teo Chee Hean.

  

Warren Fernandez, himself an SJI Old Boy and Editor of The Straits Times, chaired the first Lecture Series and also collated a book on the first Series entitled “[**Lead your Life**](/news-and-events/news-highlights/2012#_ptoh_38744)”. The reception to this has been enormously encouraging as it has allowed us to broaden the reach of this remarkable series.

  

The Fullerton-SJI Leadership Lectures are organized under the auspices of Fullerton Hotel and St Joseph’s Institution (SJI), with The Straits Times, our media partner.

  

The second Fullerton–SJI Leadership Lectures Series kicked off in August 2012, with prominent leaders from the Lasallian family of schools which include SJI alumni such as Professor Leo Tan Wee Hin, Richard Magnus, Tony Chew Leong Chee, Professor Jeremy Monteiro, Brother Armin Luistro FSC, KF Seetoh, and the President of Singapore, Dr Tony Tan.  

  

President Tony Tan launched the new SJI book, "[**Lasallian Pathfinders: Of Ordinary Men and Less Ordinary Leadership**](/news-and-events/news-highlights/2015#_ptoh_60172)”, a collection of leadership lectures from the  Fullerton–SJI Leadership Lectures Series II on 20 July 2015.
