As part of the inaugural Singapore SailGP regatta, SJI sailors **Russell Yom** (FN604) and **Kenan Tan** (FN401) from the Singapore Sailing Federation were selected to participate in the SailGP Inspire WASZP Racing series. Apart from being provided with an exclusive behind-the-scenes glimpse into the internationally acclaimed event, the boys pitted against some of the very best Under-21 sailors in Singapore for the chance to represent the Nation at the SailGP Inspire Grand Final held in San Francisco. With unyielding light winds throughout the series, racing took place in immensely tricky conditions just meters away from the East Coast Park shoreline. After three days of extremely tight racing, SJI is proud to announce that Russell and Kenan have ultimately emerged as joint vice-champions in the male division. Congratulations!

#### **January: Josephians Reach Out to the Community**
As part of their Values-in-Action (VIA) project and in partnership with the People's Association, the entire cohort of 360 Year 4 boys helped and guided senior citizens on the redemption of their CDC vouchers from 4 to 11 January. Besides teaching the elderly how to redeem their vouchers online using their SingPass and printing out vouchers at 36 community centres around Singapore, the Josephians also reached out to the merchants and hawkers to encourage the adoption of the CDC vouchers at their shops or stalls.

Ably led by the Year 4 student leaders from Prefectorial Board, the boys started planning the manpower schedule and worked on the translation of basic conversational terms and scripts to dialogue with the elderly since December 2022.

#### **January: Welcoming the Year 1s to the SJI Community**

The Year 1 Orientation Programme resumed with much excitement and fanfare after a 3-year hiatus, to welcome the youngest Josephians into the SJI community. Besides the overnight camp, the Year 1s spent their first week exploring the various CCAs, from sports to the uniformed groups and performing arts.

The fortnight-long orientation programme concluded with the Initiation Ceremony and the long-awaited campfire on 13 January, celebrated with more than 700 parents, students and alumni. There were many firsts at this year's Orientation Programme, one of which was introducing a cohort batch song, “We are the Young.”

The 2023 Year 1 Orientation Programme continues to reiterate our focus on community, and it is through this community of Peer Support Leaders, Peer Support Facilitators, CCA leaders, new friends, and teachers that the Year 1s will grow and develop in SJI. The brotherhood and friendships forged show the significance that we continue to be with all – a community that cares and serves.

#### **January: Year 3 Josephians Bond Through TABA**

Embarking on a new journey in upper secondary, the Year 3 Josephians discovered the importance of community and being a person for others at TABA - Together and by Association. During this two-day programme held on 3 and 4 Jan, the boys learnt about their own calling to be servant leaders and the importance of class community. They began with a class envisioning exercise where facilitators guided the boys on the importance of working together as a class. The students analyzed their own strengths and personality profiles through the DISC assessment which in turn contributed to classroom discussions on how each of them was called to be active contributors to recognising the vision and goals of their class.

The second half of the TABA programme sent the students on a trip to East Coast park for a morning of sandcastle building. Students were guided in designing and constructing these sandcastles which resulted in a time of fun, laughter and camaraderie while not forgetting the important skills of working together as a community.

The TABA programme was to prepare the boys for the challenges ahead and to remind them of the Lasallian charisms of being in association with one another and with the last, the lost and the least. TABA concluded with a Paraliturgy conducted by the Form Teachers where this same message of the Founder St John Baptist De Lasalle was reiterated and contemplated upon.

The Class of 2022 includes 117 boys who were admitted to SJI at Secondary 1 in 2017 under the 6-year Integrated Programme that leads to the IBDP in years 5 and 6. The results achieved by our Class of 2022 is evident of a trend that the SJI IBDP relates well with students who enjoyed high academic expectations from the programme. They have found joy in learning by being critical thinkers and risk-takers who pursue their interests and passion by moving beyond their comfort zone to serve the community even during the pandemic.

Mr Justin Arul Pierre, Principal of SJI, says “The Class of 2022 has demonstrated that resilience, determination, effort and great faith in their ability to overcome challenges can produce good results, despite having to navigate through the various disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The students exemplified the very best of being a Josephian – by staying the course with faith to keep learning, through service to help each other through the examinations, and as one community to look forward with hope. The excellent results testify to the work of the competent and caring teachers who are always prepared to go the extra mile and they have done all this in the face of the more demanding circumstances of this pandemic time. The school is immensely proud of their achievements and wishes them the very best as they move on to seek their passion in their future endeavours.”  

As a Catholic and Lasallian school, SJI is committed to developing every student’s character and to helping them realize their academic potential so that they become men and women whose education empowers them to make a positive difference in the world. The IBDP results of the 2022 cohort are an affirmation of the quality of the balanced and holistic education offered at SJI.
