#### December: Alumnus is Chairman of the Archdiocesan Commissions for Catholic Schools

Education Minister Heng Swee Keat wants values and character development to be a priority for schools. Professor Tan Cheng Han (SJI Graduating class of 1980) the new chairman of the Archdiocesan Commission for Catholic Schools, reflects on how Catholic schools have worked at fulfilling their social mission in his speech.

  

"While I understand fully the importance of academic rigour, it sometimes strikes me that we over-emphasise this at the expense of other important dimensions", says Professor Tan.

  

"My view of education was shaped by the type of education that I received in SJI in the late 1970s," he states. "I was struck by the goodness and selflessness of the Christian Brothers in the school … I also recall the strong values that were an integral part of my scouting co-curricular activity (CCA) in the 2104 Pelandok Scout Group." Being a man for others was always emphasised, Professor Tan recalls.

  

"Ultimately a child needs to be properly grounded with right values and character traits if he or she is to thrive in the world beyond childhood. This is where I think our Catholic schools have done better than most."

Ricky Ho (SJI Graduating Class of 1975) has won the award for Best Original Film Score in the 2011 Golden Horse Film Awards. This adds to an already extensive list of prestigious awards the composer and producer has received for film-scoring, writing jingles and producing.

  

Ricky Ho was born in Hong Kong but raised in Singapore. He is currently based locally. He is a graduate of the Grove School of Music in Los Angeles and has worked in virtually every part of the Asia-Pacific region, including Taiwan, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Malaysia. 

  

He has won 65 advertising awards worldwide for his scoring for commercials for companies like Nippon and Bank of China and produced artistes like Tracy Huang, Sally Yeh, Allan Tam and Andy Lau.

  

In SJI, Ricky was the Class Monitor of Sec4 Arts7. His brother, Bernie, was in the same class. Both Ricky and Bernie had great interest in running and sprinting. Ricky also represented SJI in Athletics for the 100m and 4x100m events. "I had an unforgettable time, especially in Sec 4," says Ricky.

  

#### November: Living the Mission


Mohamed Fareez Mohamed Fahmy (SJI Graduating Class of 1997) has been awarded the title of The Most Promising Social Worker.

After leaving SJI, Fareez went to NJC and NUS where he majored in Social Work.  Upon Graduation he worked as a social worker at the Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centres and later was involved in the setting up of a new prison services initiative called the NEXUS Programme and the Family Resource Centre in the Changi Prison Link Centre.

  

While in college, Fareez knew that he wanted to be involved in work that saw tangible benefits to society. He was motivated by the work ethic of his colleagues and supervisors at the Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centres who are really the ones who inspired him to think creatively and out of the box.

  

About SJI, he shared, “SJI, the teachers, and peers, certainly placed a big role in my decision to be a social worker. I was always impressed by the selflessness of teachers like Ms Chia who took pains to get to know her students better on top of just focusing on teaching. 

  

SJI is a school that does not only focus on grades, but on the building up of character, as evident in moral education lessons that take precedence in our education. Although I am not Catholic, I felt very much a member of the SJI family, and the lessons I learnt there about being a man for others, is certainly a value that I keep to heart today.”

#### November: Silver award at The National StrITwise® Challenge 2011


<img src="/images/2011-11-12%2014_22_44.jpeg"  
style="width:60%">

The National StrITwise® Challenge is a flagship national IT competition organised for secondary school students. It is a broad-based infocomm and interactive digital media competition conceptualised by Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s School of InfoComm Technology, with the objective of developing the awareness and interest in IT in a fun and engaging way. 

  

The SJI team comprised Tan E-Liang (321), Tay Tian Hoe (333), Ian Yeap (212), Hubert Yeo (212), Jon Tan (212) and Joshua O’Hara (204).

  

They took on three categories: StrITcombat - a true test of technical coding skill; StrITDesign - where craft meets style; and StrITBiz - a rigorous drill of research and analytical skills put on trial.

  

For the StrITBiz category, Andrew, Hubert and Ian did an impressive market report based on a case study of the Apple Ipad and the Samsung Galaxy Tab. The report was certainly impressive - 8 pages including a full bibliography. 

  

For StrITCombat, the boys programmed a virtual robot to fight other schools' robots in a virtual environment. This category required lots of coding expertise and time for trial and error. 

  

The boys shined at the StrITDesign category. They were judged on 4 aspects: process, animation (of the storyline), cosplay and presentation. The design team really went above and beyond to produce a unique, gritty and very authentic storyline and experience for the audience.

#### August: Hair for Hope @SJI

<img src="/images/HFH%20.jpeg"  
style="width:70%">

When SJI started Hair for Hope in 2008, it was a student-led initiative by the 2008 Prefectorial Board at that time. In 2008, SJI saw about 160 staff and students giving up their crowning glory to raise awareness for childhood cancer. 

  

And into its fourth year, the tradition remains strong. On 26 Aug, we saw 211 boys shaving their heads and a collection of about $19,000 for the Children’s Cancer Foundation.

  

Mrs Mishaelle Chua, who was not ready to shave her head this year, managed to raise about $2,000. She said, “I hope with that amount of donation, it is my way to show support to my students who are organising the event.” 

  

It was also her way of sharing a very special message: Some see a hopeless end while others see endless hope.

**Another GOLD for SJI at SYF**

  

The [**SJI Guitar Ensemble**](https://sites.google.com/a/sji.edu.sg/guitar-ensemble/home/syf-central-judging) took GOLD for the Guitar category at the SYF competition. With 27 members, the senior ensemble was one of the smallest teams at the SYF Central Judging for Guitar Ensembles 2011. The SJI members capitalized on their strong bonds to encourage and inspire each other to achieve their best, and achieved the GOLD Award this year.

  

The choice of pieces by ensemble trainer, Mr Michael Gaspar, an old boy of the school, was a critical factor too. The first piece, Austin Tango was composed in 2009 by Roland Dyens, a French interpreter, composer, arranger and improviser. The second piece, Kalimba is another relatively modern piece composed by Jurg Kindle. 

  

The SYF Central Judging has been a very good learning experience. Far more important than the GOLD though is that the members continue to learn and grow as musicians and friends to each other because those are what they will remember and retain in years to come.

SJI hosted a combined school choir mini‐concert at The Beurel (SJI library) on Saturday, 26 March 2011 from 5.15pm to 6.00pm to raise funds for the victims of the earthquake/tsunami in Japan.

  

The combined choir comprised choral groups from the SJI Vocal Ensemble, Dunman Secondary School Choir, Catholic Junior College Choir, Raffles Chorale, Raffles Voices, and the Raffles Voices Alumni. The Choral Director for the schools is Mr Toh Ban Sheng.

  

The concert was aptly titled Ubi caritas et amor, Deus ibi est ‐ Where charity and love are, God is there. This fund‐raising effort, which is the brainchild of Mr Toh, aligns very well with SJI’s ethos and mission to reach out to the community and make a difference to ‘the last, the lost and the least’. 

  

About 260 students, parents and well-wishers listened with awe and wonder as The Beurel filled with the beautiful voices of the various choir. 

  

Proceeds from the evening went to Mercy Relief.

#### March: Josephian in the National Debate Team

<img src="/images/rabin.jpeg"  
style="width:60%">

Rabin Kok (434) has made it to the National Debate Team. He will start training with the current National team. The team will be representing Singapore at the World Schools Debating Competition in South Africa in 2012. 

  

Rabin is the first Josephian on the list of debaters for this team.

  

Rabin has been a member of the SJI Debate Society since 2008.  His ability to grasp complex ideas and express them simply is one of his key strengths. This ability was clearly seen in his academic work and even during RME lessons which involved discussion on moral and social issues.

  

He represented SJI at various Mock United Nations Conferences. Rabin was also the student leader in charge of the inaugural SJI U-14 Debate Tournament which was successfully run in 2010.

#### March: National Cross Country Champ

At the National Cross Country Competition on 23 March 2011, SJI runner Karthic Harish (433) took the individual Gold medal once again. 

<img src="/images/karthic.jpeg"  
style="width:60%">  

In 2010, Karthic (in pic) attained a credible third position, competing against the older Sec 4 boys. This year, he cruised home in style taking the top spot without any challenge. Karthic has been nursing a shin splint injury for the last few months. He was determined in his training, but also very careful not to exasperate the injury.

  

This would be Karthic's second Championship title at the National Inter-School Cross Country Championships. He also won the title in 2009 in the 'C' Division category. He holds bragging rights as the second male athlete to have won GOLD in both the 'C' and 'B' Divisions (Individual category). The other athlete was also a Josephian.  

  

The SJI cross country team emerged fourth in the ‘B’ division Team category. Credit goes to the hardwork and dedication of the team, led by captains Karthic and Justin Tan (421). Justin bagged the 8th position in the Individual competition.

#### February: Read it. Like it. Pass it on

<img src="/images/Bookcrossing.jpeg"  
style="width:60%">

On April 2010, Brandon Krygsman (201), Kenneth Sean Teo (201), Heng On Scott (201), Jared Martens Wong (204) and Bryan Lim Jun Hao (209), together with the help of their teachers Mrs Mishaelle Chua, Mrs Adeline Tan and Ms Elisa Tan, launched a project, Bookcrossing@SJI. The project served to widen a student’s exposure to different genres of books and to spur the interest for reading in even the most reluctant of readers.

  

“Bookcrossing” is the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise. The collection of books in the six Bookcrossing zones at SJI is sustained by the donation of books from teachers, students and the National Library Board (NLB).

  

To enrich the experience, an online forum was created to allow students to share their views on the books they have read. Students can also join the Facebook group, Worm E, creating an avenue for students with a common interest to discuss and interact.

  

A student-initiated project, the organizing committee plans include critique of literary works, conducting monthly Reading Circles discussion of a selected text and training workshops for Reading facilitators.

  

Their efforts at promoting reading caught the attention of NLB who invited the boys and teachers to share their reading programme at one of the NLB workshops in March.
