#### October: End-of-Year Thanksgiving Celebration

SJI marks the closing of the school year with the Thanksgiving Ceremony every year. This year, the theme ‘Curating a difference - stars of gratitude’ was to celebrate our gratitude towards everything that came and passed us by throughout the year, in spite of the challenges of the evolving pandemic and safe distancing measures.

  

In gratitude, we also celebrated the gift of those staff who will be leaving the school as they move on to other opportunities or to celebrate their retirement. The Thanksgiving Ceremony was also the last official school event for Fr Adrian Danker where he concluded his appointment as Principal and handed over the leadership of the school to the incoming Principal Mr Justin Arul Pierre, with the SJI tradition of presenting the school flag.

  

The ceremony also saw the launch of the 170th anniversary logo for SJI, which the school will celebrate in 2022.

#### October: Record number of recipients at The Queen's Commonwealth Essay Competition

 <img src="![](/images/2-Gold.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

SJI is proud that the number of our young writers has grown from strength to strength, with the number of winners surging to 193 (3 Gold Finalists, 22 Gold, 59 Silver and 109 Bronze recipients) in 2021, from 43 in 2019 to 81 in 2020!

  

Among the 26,000 entries from across the Commonwealth, our Josephians from Years 1 and 2 shared their views on the topic of ‘Community in the Commonwealth’, with attention on the COVID-19 pandemic and how it has affected lives of many in the Commonwealth region, and how life will be like 30 years in the future. In times of adversity, our students wrote about how communities came together, drew strength from one another and wrote stories or poems of growth, community and hope.

  

This achievement is only possible because of the belief of our teachers (Mr Azhar Ghazali, Mrs Janet Kwok, Ms Sangeetha, Mr Krison Tan, Mrs Denise Jeyaseelan, Ms Karen Alexander, Ms Valerie Koh and Ms Darrell Foo) in the students and their commitment to guide them in their writing journey.

#### October: Josephians Shine at Startathon 2021

Startathon 2021 was a gruelling competition organised by River Valley High School that comprised three key stages over 2 days, which attracted 25 teams from 15 schools across Singapore. In the first ideation stage, teams were allocated subcategories of the competition’s overarching theme: “Navigating the Pandemic”. These subcategories included “Public health”, “Education”, “Work” and more. Teams were then tasked with creating a product that solves a problem of their choice within their allocated subcategory.

  

After deciding on their product idea, teams would proceed to the next stage of the competition - the development stage, where the teams were required to produce a prototype of their product, a video of their prototype, a business lean canvas and a 2-minute presentation to the judges. Teams were able to use any means necessary to bring their idea to fruition. With development complete, teams moved onto the final stage - judging, which was split into two rounds, preliminary and final. For preliminary rounds, teams had 2 minutes to present their product. From the preliminary rounds, six teams were shortlisted for the finals where they were then engaged in 3 minutes of presentation and 2 minutes of Q&amp;A.

 <img src="![](/images/Lakeside%20Family%20Services%20Community%20Partnership%20Award.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

SJI has been awarded the Community Partnerships Award for Lakeside Volunteers' Appreciation Day 2021, thanks to a number of contributions by the students. Accolades go to the students who readily volunteered every time an appeal was posted on Managebac. The following are the various projects that the students have been involved in since 2020:

1.  Lakeside Family Services GRIT Project 2020 - an intensive online tuition for PSLE students.
2.  Lakeside Family Services Packing - a group of students helped a client to pack her home so that it would be ready for HDB upgrading works over several days. Our students were lauded for their efficiency and commitment!
3.  Lakeside Family Services Online Tuition - Academic coaching of primary to secondary students for a 4 - 6 months duration. One of the volunteers is the Year 5 President of the Student Council, Koon Wei Pheng (LE507) who initiated face-to-face tutoring of his Pri 1 mentee before heightened COVID-19 measures were enforced as he felt teaching his mentee penmanship was more effective in person rather than online.
4.  Lakeside Family Service SPARKS - Plan Dec holiday programme for primary school students and assume facilitating roles.
5.  The Lakeside Family Services #Icanbake challenge that twin brothers David Joshua Ho (ML514) and Cephas John Ho (LE506) undertook to raise $10,347 on their own accord.
6.  David Ho together with his brother Cephas initiated an SJI representation for the '4ward Together 4 Million Steps' campaign in conjunction with Lakeside Family Services. Together with their team members - Chow Zeyi (LE508), Benedict Chua (ML515), Sanjai Purushothaman (ML515), and Eddy Chan (LE506), they successfully completed the 40km night walk from Lakeside Family Services HQ at Yung Ho Road to Changi Chapel and Museum, from 8pm on 26 November to 7am on 27 November that raised more than $10,000 for ex-(inmates) and their families. More importantly, these Josephians have embodied the SJI mission of being men for others.

#### October: SJI Contributes to the Community Through CSR

As part of our school mission to help the last, the lost, and the least in the community, SJI staff continued the tradition of rendering aid to 'Food From The Heart' (FFTH), the beneficiary for our corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative since 2019. SJI staff generously contributed stockpiles of Milo packets, biscuits, sardines and baked beans tins during the two-week collection period in Term 4. The food donation drive was concluded on 4 October, when the FFTH representatives collected the donated items from the school. We hope to continue this initiative and make it an SJI tradition amongst the staff. It was heartening to see the staff give back to the community in the ways that they can.

On 1 October, SJI graduated our 8th IBDP Class as they drew to the close of their 2 or 6 years in SJI. It was an emotional and bittersweet moment for the Year 6s, especially after two challenging and turbulent "Covid years", marked by much uncertainty. Yet, they celebrated their growth and their resilience, their love for the school and the community that makes SJI so special. Despite all the current guidelines and restrictions, their graduation day was joyous and meaningful.

  

"_I came into a school and I found a home, I didn’t find classmates, I found a family_." Nathaneal Sutjiutama (President of Student Council 2020-2021) made this reflection at the ceremony. He beautifully expressed the thoughts and feelings of this year's graduating class. For these students, the gift of SJI and our Josephian community puts in perspective these past two years.

  

COVID-19 robbed these Josephians of the best years of school. They lost out on so much for a healthy, happy school life. But they overcame the virus by seizing opportunities to grow, turning adversity into possibilities, and looking out constantly for the brighter side in the dark and difficult. They found these by paying attention to the little things, the quiet moments, and the everyday rhythms and people in their SJI experience. They found these most of all in caring for one another and being happy in friendship. Yes, they lived in spite of the virus. Truly, these Josephians are an exceptional class: they're a fine balance of grit and compassion.

  

To God be the glory for each of these fine Josephian graduates - they will shine like stars that light up the night!

#### September: Year 4 OP Graduation Ceremony

On 30 September 2021, SJI celebrated the graduation of 254 Year 4 boys from the O-Level Programme. The day marked the official end of their four-year journey in SJI, but also the start of their final stretch to the O-Level examination and a whole new journey ahead of them.

  

Four years ago, the boys joined SJI, innocent, eager, and wanting to excel. They graduate mature, caring, and determined to serve. More significantly, they graduate "_not as a family by blood but brothers by heart_," Lutfil Hadi Bin Iskandar (LE402) said.

  

For all of us, the Class of 2021 is special. Not because COVID-19 overwhelmed them but because they overcame Covid by staying the course with faith to keep learning, through service to help each other through the examinations, and as a community to look forward with hope. The school has great faith that they will go forth and change the world for the better.

  

In spite of safe distancing measures put in place, the graduation was celebrated in style in every class, with their classmates and form tutors, from the quiet reflection during the paraliturgy to the presentation of the top awards at the graduation ceremony. The highlight was the surprise farewell from the Year 4s, where the Prefect ExCo presented a token of appreciation to departing Principal Fr Adrian Danker at the end of the celebrations.

#### September: SJI MTL Educators Share Innovative Pedagogies at MOE MTLS

The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) is an annual event jointly organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC). It seeks to recognise and showcase the continual efforts and progress of schools and MTL communities in encouraging our young to learn MTL, and in promoting our MTL as living languages. This year, MTLS celebrates its 10th anniversary.

  

The theme for MTLS 2021 is “Our Mother Tongues as Living Languages”. The focus will be on creating authentic settings and immersive environments beyond the classroom to engage children in using our MTLs for meaningful MTL learning experiences and interaction, in order to foster interest and a keen sense of life-long learning of MTLs in our children.

  

SJI's MTL Department participated as an exhibitor in MTLS, sharing their experience on the use of innovative and engaging pedagogies in the teaching and learning of the Chinese Language. The team has effectively incorporated e-learning into pedagogical practice as a way of promoting collaborative learning among students. Teachers use different teaching tools such as Jamboard, Flipgrid and ITT in the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) to facilitate student-to-student interaction, student-content interaction, and to make students' thinking visible.  

  

Given both teacher guidance and technology that complements teaching and learning, students have more opportunities to share their views, work productively in groups to co-create knowledge, acquire peer review skills and give constructive feedback to help one another improve and achieve learning goals together.

September: Teachers' Day Celebrations
-------------------------------------

SJI commemorated Teachers Day together as one community on 2 September. The theme for this year’s edition of Teachers’ Day, Et Alma Curant, which means to care and nurture, succinctly captures the essence of teaching and what teachers throughout the ages have represented and stood for. The staff in SJI have proven to be stalwarts of learning - they are a dependable and strong pillar of support for our students, giving them a sense of normalcy in this period of immense uncertainty and fast-paced change.

  
![TD.gif](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/TD.gif)

September: Tribute to Mr Francis Loh, Former SJI Teacher &amp; Josephian
--------------------------------------------------------------------

![JA2003-FrancisLoh 2.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/JA2003-FrancisLoh%202.jpg)

Mr Loh Siew Khan Francis passed away peacefully yesterday. He retired from SJI as Vice-principal (Administration) in 2003, after close to 5 decades of dedicated service. He joined the school on 10 Jan 1955, serving SJI and 3 other Lasallian schools in various appointments as a teacher, senior assistant, vice-principal and assistant principal. He will always be remembered as a firm but fair man. Beneath his serious disposition is a caring and warm heart. He always encouraged and inspired his students to achieve their best both in and out of the classroom. He has developed many student leaders in the 1970s - 1980s when he was the prefect master. In recognition of his commitment and service, he was awarded the Loyal Lasallian Service award in 1999 and the Lasallian Distinguished Service Award in 2002. He was given the title Benefactor of the Institute by the Brothers in Nov 2003.

Eternal rest grant unto Francis, O Lord,

and let perpetual light shine upon him.

May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed,

through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.

August: Josephians Win Awards in Art and Design Competitions
------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations to&nbsp;**Santino Dev Joseph Xavier**&nbsp;(LE103) on being awarded 3rd prize in the Colours of the Bible Art Competition 2021 organized by The Bible Society of Singapore!

  

His illustration was expressed in art in this quote: "The Bible is full of new beginnings. From God using the least to confound the mighty, to God working behind the scenes to provide a breakthrough for a character, God is often the central figure that propels change for that character. “New Beginnings” sparks hope in one’s heart, and hope does not disappoint."

August: Josephians Win Awards in Essay and Poetry Competitions
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Jack Li Murray Wigmore**&nbsp;(FN203) on winning one of the awards at the Live On Festival, an initiative by the National Organ Transplant Unit, Ministry of Health! Launched in 2018 as the Live On Design Competition (LODC), the competition is renamed as Live On Festival (LOF) following an expansion to include writing in 2021.

(L-R):

5th Place:&nbsp;**Lim Ruey Shuane**&nbsp;(ML513),&nbsp;**Dhanush Anilkumarapillai**&nbsp;(LE507),&nbsp;**Aarushi Mathur**&nbsp;(LE510),\[_Absent_:&nbsp;**Tay Yu Harng Zldyn**&nbsp;(LE515),&nbsp;**Lee Qi Xuan**&nbsp;(LE510)\]

Attracting teams from schools the world over, the Ethics Olympiad was a prestigious global competition that tested the ability of participants to make cogent ethical decisions based on real-world case studies, ranging from the validity of exploitation in the K pop industry to the ethicality of fast fashion.

  

SJI had sent two teams to participate in the preliminary round of the competition, which was held through Zoom. After countless sessions of training and sparring, both teams entered the gruelling phases of the competition with hearts of steel. Though the teams faced many challenges such as tough opponents and technical difficulties, both teams emerged victorious from the struggle, earning the fourth and fifth spot amidst tenacious competition from many other teams. As an added bonus, the team which placed fourth were invited to participate in the finals of the competition - a great honour. Through this competition, both teams gained invaluable experience in approaching ethical debates with restraint and clarity of expression, putting them in a position to appreciate the greyness of this highly contested area of philosophy.

August: Keeping the Faith Alive Through Online Video Streaming
--------------------------------------------------------------

Did you know that SJI has an online prayer channel on YouTube where Josephians can come together to pray every morning? Thanks to a tech-savvy Year 4 Josephian - Xavier Pan, who initiated this idea of conducting online morning prayers for the SJI Catholic community during the pandemic. This idea was conceived at a time when Home-Based Learning began last year. He rallied his friends to chip in and soon they began preparing and recording their daily prayer videos for streaming. Watch his faith story below.

August: SJI's Team WishyWashy Clinches Merit Award at NXplorers 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Two SJI teams participated in the NXplorers 2021 competition organised by the Science Centre and Shell Singapore. It is a science-based competition with the objective of developing sustainable solutions to food, water and energy challenges. The teams are:

1.  **Kieran Tan, Horatius Koh, Matthew Oon, Tay Kia Yong**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Sim Weilun**&nbsp;(all from FN302) – Team WishyWashy
2.  **Balakrishnan Akshath, Ethan Ng Ming Jun, Isaac Wong Xin Kai, Kayden Ee Kai Wen**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Saravanan Meyyappan**&nbsp;(all from ML202; they received Certificates of Participation)

Driven by their passion for science, Team WishyWashy decided to tackle an issue every Singaporean would be familiar with – the high amount of domestic water usage. They conceptualised a prototype that allows the recycling of laundry water. With the help of their mentor from Shell and teacher-in-charge Ms Gina Tan, the team designed a product that could purify laundry water at a low cost, through processes such as coagulation, flocculation, adsorption and filtration. Their creative prototype clinched the merit award (top 4) against 127 teams from 52 schools!

  

Through this fulfilling journey, the team learnt more about a sustainable future and the need to combat the issues at hand. The NXtools learnt have equipped them with the necessary skills to be positive agents of change and make an impact on the environment.

August: Josephians Shine at Business Plan Competition
-----------------------------------------------------

The SUSS SBIZ Business Plan Competition 2021 is an entrepreneurial competition that challenged student participants to come up with their own creative and innovative solutions to socio-economic issues that are arising in an increasingly digitalised Singapore during this pandemic.

  

SJI’s Team Sapientiae established their business plan offering smart glasses that are powered by Artificial Intelligence and innovative features such as facial recognition, augmented reality navigation and cognitive stimulating games. This solution is to improve the independence and mobility of the elderly, especially those with early stage dementia, in response to the rapidly growing elderly population in Singapore. Team Sapientiae emerged as the Champion in this competition against 43 other teams from major educational institutions in Singapore.

  

SJI's 2nd team - Team Espoir came in 4th place with their environmental proposal that focused on solving the problem of surges in disposable mask wastage due to COVID-19 and its negative impact on the environment. The solution involves the collection of used masks from the public and centralised procedures that eventually turn them into a substitute for asphalt, which can be used in road construction. Digitalisation is incorporated into Team Espor's business idea via the use of a location tracking mobile app to help donors find the closest mask collection bins. Their core value emphasizes slow-but-steady business expansion that eventually positions Singapore as the mask recycling hub of the world, coupled with awareness campaigns to educate the public about PPE plastic recycling.

Congratulations to&nbsp;**Aeden Chng**&nbsp;(LE303) on being awarded the best position paper at the Raffles Model United Nations 2021!&nbsp;**Zhuo Chengsheng**&nbsp;(LE403),&nbsp;**Keevan Kanagalingam**&nbsp;(LE403) and&nbsp;**Assis Franklin Kevin Benedict**&nbsp;(ML403) - as delegates of Malta, USA and Canada respectively - on being given honourable mentions.

  

“Reforming the United Nations Security Council" was the topic of discussion at the Raffles MUN, one that is deeply relevant to current issues in the United Nations with greatly differing opinions across various blocks of nations. A very detailed and comprehensive study guide was provided to all delegates under the United Nations general assembly which allowed all delegates equal ability and context to perform well based on their countries’ stance. It was an opportunity for the boys to glean an understanding of worldly issues and their impact or influence on people's lives.

August: Commemorating National Day 2021
---------------------------------------

  

(photos: ‘together’ by Fr Adrian Danker, SJ)

  

This National Day will be muted and sober again as we stay safer in this pandemic. This has been a long, exhausting, painful, even heartbreaking time. Is there cause to celebrate?

  

In SJI, we reflected on two reasons to celebrate.

  

First, "Together, Still." In spite of the pandemic, we are still alive and well, safe and healthy. And we still have family, friends, and the SJI community who care, encourage and support us onward. On birthdays, we celebrate God's blessings with a meal together. SJI's ND celebrations included a school-wide breakfast - a choice of bento boxes of local fare -- for everyone because we are SJI! (Breakfast was eaten observing SMM.)

  

Second, "Together, for better." We build up Singapore together. I challenged Josephains to "...commit yourselves to this task. We, your teachers and parents, are doing this now – for the nation and for you. On the road ahead, we need you to come on board with your gifts. ...So, don’t just receive; give. Don’t just take; share. Don’t complain; improve. Don’t be a keyboard warrior; be the change you want to see. Don’t think of yourself always; put others first each time. Let us make the change ... in our distinctively Josephian way – by being a blessing to all as Jospehians for others \[and\] the common good, 'regardless of race, language or religion.'" Our support staff and school leaders modelled the way by packing all 2300 bento boxes into bags for our classes for our SJI ND breakfast.

  

Let’s live and act for the better for everyone in SJI and around us. Then we make true these words in our Anthem to advance our nation onward — Majulah Singapura!

  

Happy National Day!

August: Josephians Scores Distinction at IM2C Singapore
-------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations to our Josephians who scored distinctions at IM²C Singapore!

  

The International Math Modelling Challenge (IM²C Singapore) is a competition for Singapore Secondary and JC students. IM²C (Singapore), which takes a similar form and structure as the international edition of IM²C, is jointly organised by the Academy of Singapore Teachers, National Junior College and Raffles Girls School.

  

In March 2021, five Year 4 and three Year 5 Josephians -&nbsp;**Boey Yui Jit**&nbsp;(FN403),&nbsp;**Seng Liang Gin Johann**&nbsp;(LE403),&nbsp;**Jaryl Lee (Jaryl Li Enjie)**&nbsp;(FN403),&nbsp;**Anish Ketan Gathani**&nbsp;(FN403),&nbsp;**Sudhan Harez Vinshan**&nbsp;(FN401),&nbsp;**Evan Michael Neo Ren Jie**&nbsp;(ML512),&nbsp;**Loh Zi Quan Keith**&nbsp;(ML511),&nbsp;**Timothy Tan**&nbsp;(FN501) - in two teams of four represented SJI to compete against 47 other teams from different schools in Singapore.

  

Sacrificing their school term break, each team worked independently to develop an original mathematical model to answer the highly debatable question in sports, “Who is the GOAT?” (GOAT stands for the “greatest of all time”)

  

In creating their own mathematical models, the students used basic and advanced concepts in Probability Theory and developed their mathematical framework further, with the help of Optimisation Theory. They then generated their results and proceeded with&nbsp;Statistical Testing in order to validate and refine their answers. Despite just being high school students, our teams showed maturity and utilised mathematical techniques way beyond their years. By the end of the competition, both teams were awarded the Distinction honour for their efforts and the quality of their work.

  

This is the third year that SJI students have participated in IM²C (Singapore). In 2019, SJI sent one team that received a Merit award. In 2020, two teams participated where one achieved a Distinction award and the other a Merit award.

July: Josephians Awarded Best Prototype Award at Young Technopreneur Challenge
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 teams of Josephians participated in the Young Technopreneur Challenge (YTC) 2021 organised by Junior Achievement Singapore during the June holidays. They were mentored by Mr Colin Toh, Mr Eric Lam and Mr Thomas Yeo:

*   **Dinh Nho An, Nguyen Duc Minh Anh, Nguyen Phuc Chuong**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Nguyen Thien Minh Tuan**&nbsp;(FN303) -&nbsp;**_Runner-Up team!_**
*   **Nguyen Phuc Truong**&nbsp;(FN303),&nbsp;**Aarush Nair**&nbsp;(FN303),&nbsp;**Tran Thanh Hung**&nbsp;(MN301) and&nbsp;**Le Xuan Hai**&nbsp;(FN301)
*   **Agil Singaraselvan, Chen Wei En James Ryan, Seow Yong Ann Reuben**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Harjas Singh Sidhu**&nbsp;(ML301)

![YTC1.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/YTC1.jpg)  

Congratulations to the Runner-Up team who proceeded to the finals and was awarded the Best Prototype Award! Their prototype aims to find out the relationship between microclimates and health so that it could help to protect the community from harmful external factors as well as improve their performance and reduce stress levels.

![YTC2.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/YTC2.jpg)  

The YTC aims to support students to take ownership of the world they live in and actively develop solutions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, Singapore Green Plan 2030 and Sustainable South West Masterplan. The objective of the competition is to interest, excite and provide participants with a unique platform to stretch their imagination and push their boundaries to learn to think global, innovate, create and pitch an idea or concept by making use of STEM and technology.

  

Nguyen Duc Minh Anh: “_Technopreneur has been mind-opening for me as well as my teammates - Tuan, Chuong and An. We have gained a lot of experience in terms of teamwork and actualizing our product. We did not win 1st place, however, we hope that our product can further be developed to find out the relationship between microclimates and health so that it could help to protect our community from harmful external factors as well as improve our performance and reduce stress levels._”

  

Tran Thanh Hung: “_Young Technopreneur Challenge 2021 has been an incredible learning opportunity for me. First of all, I learned skills such as design thinking, programming languages (Python and HTML), and presentation. Moreover, I appreciate the opportunity to work with my friends in solving global problems. The problem our team wanted to tackle was the growing digital divide in developing countries, whose impacts were further exacerbated by the pandemic. After doing research on this issue, I gained a deeper understanding of the struggles of people in these part of the world (which includes of Vietnam, my home country), and felt responsible for making a change. From that, I have also grown to be more humble and grateful for my upbringing and the opportunities I was given. Additionally, our teamwork sessions taught me the values of cooperation. Throughout the competition, I learned to encourage my quieter teammates to participate in group discussions. I realised that when I actively asked them questions and complimented their ideas, they were more eager to share, which helped us ultimately to create a better final product with the feedback of all four team members. Overall, YTC2021 has been an incredibly enriching experience for me._”

May: SJI Debaters Spar Online During Pandemic
---------------------------------------------

Even as the pandemic continues to plague the world and hamper our daily school life, the SJI debaters continued to interact and reach out to fellow debaters from other schools at the SJI inter-school debate sessions.

  

Our junior debaters from Years 1 and 2 met their counterparts from Singapore American School (SAS) at SJI's Inter-School Debate III on 23 March. This was an impromptu debate where debaters from both schools argued for and against the following motion: "This House believes that major film and television awards should abolish award categories which are separated by gender".

  

On 20 April, our Josephian debaters met the team from Zhong Hua Secondary School (ZHSS) at SJI's 4th Inter-School Debate. SJI was represented by Debaters from the FPAM and OPAM academies. Our debaters argued well and were commended for their abilities.

  

The sessions were organised by the SJI Debate Society - Pham Ngoc Diep (President), Alwyn Choo Khai Hong (Vice-President) and Harith Zaydan Bin Imran (JDEP Coordinator), and supported by several enthusiastic Josephian observers.

May: Josephians Score at National Social Innovation Relay (SIR) Competition 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SJI teams won the second and third places in the National Social Innovation Relay (SIR) Competition 2021. The teams went through many phases of selection - from 104 team submissions to qualifying to the top 20, and finally making it to the top 10 finalists.

  

The team that came in third is Team DJ Luckas, from Year 4IP Signum Fidei Programme:&nbsp;**Lucas Soh Keng How, Dinesh John Peeris, Caelan Kang Tze Khye and Jeremy Kiang**&nbsp;from LE403. The team recognised that the visually handicapped desired a sense of independence and confidence in public. Many do not have access to guide dogs, leading them to use walking sticks. However, this often comes with limitations and may not be able to accommodate their needs. The team designed the 'Solostick' which aims to help visually handicapped users gain independence through its simple, innovative and effective functions. The team was mentored by Wen Yankai (MN620) from PRISM.

April: Celebrating 169th Founder's Day &amp; 20th Anniversary of The Beurel’s Opening
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![2021-04-30-Founder's Day](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51216606472_faab13deaa_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/albums/72157719370853550 "2021-04-30-Founder's Day")  

Every Founder’s Day, the SJI community celebrates the Founder of Lasallian schools, St John Baptist De La Salle (30 April 1651 - 7 April 1719), his life and work in education, especially for the poor. He is the role model for Josephians to be a person of integrity and a person for others. Today, the Lasallian mission of education continues in more than 80 countries around the world.

  

This year, in conjunction with Founder’s Day on 30 April, we also commemorated the 20th anniversary of the opening of our library - The Beurel. It was officially opened on Founder's Day in 2001. The theme for this year’s Founder’s Day - Ignite - is fitting for this occasion as it reminds us of the important role the passion for learning can play in inspiring students to seek new knowledge in this rapidly changing digital information age.

  

At the Founder’s Day assembly, we celebrated the success of our students who have displayed zeal and perseverance in the past year and shown progress and achievements in character and their studies. The presentation of Founder’s Day awards was conducted in two parts: the character and scholarship awards were presented at this event, while the remaining academic awards will be presented to the recipients in Term 3.

  

In closing the celebrations, Fr Adrian Danker, S,J. reminded the school of the holy boldness Fr Beurel and the first De La Salle Brothers in Singapore had. God's fire that they educate everyone moved them to set up SJI. He challenged Josephians today and in the future to have this same fire; it will be the necessary holy boldness SJI needs to move forward with significance.

By Mrs Mishaelle Chua

EPIC Lit Fest 2021 celebrates amazing and outstanding characters and stories from the old world to the new world, from classics to modern, from fantasy to fiction to non-fiction. This year, the Year 1 students had the opportunity to experience characters come alive as they don costumes, participate in quizzes as well as theatre workshop. On top of that, like any literary event, teachers shared their favourite book characters and stories from both Western and Chinese literature, certainly enriching the lives of many bookworms and opened their eyes to the literary world of words, setting, atmosphere and culture.

April: Developing Green Reading Habits Through Book Swap
--------------------------------------------------------

![bookswap.gif](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/bookswap.gif)

In the spirit of encouraging and developing environmentally-conscious readers among the Josephians, the Library organized a Book Swap event on 27 April, in support of Earth Day. Teachers and students alike brought books from their homes, where fellow Josephians in the community can benefit from the exchange. With the focus centred on reusing and recycling, we hope that this is the beginning of inculcating in Josephians a zero-waste reading lifestyle!

The SJI Uniformed Groups celebrated the 169th Anniversary Parade on 19 April. In spite of the various safe management measures and restrictions, our Josephians have learnt to adapt to changes and challenges to celebrate life, especially those important moments in a cadet's life.

  

While there was no pomp, cheers or music like the grandeur of past parades, yet the scaled-down Parade carried on its tradition and ritual, in dignity and style. A select group representing the UG Contingents lined up in the Indoor Sports Hall, while the other cadets watched the Parade as it was live-streamed into classrooms. The School Colours were paraded. Commands were given and salutes were made. Cadet prizewinners and long-serving teachers were honoured. The highlight of every Parade was the Changing of Command and the recitation of the Josephian Pledge. An SJI tradition that was preserved to keep our SJI spirit alive.

  

Congratulations to the Senior Cadets for a year of leadership and service as they stepped down and all the best to the new cadets who will now lead SJI's NCC Land, NCC Air, St John's Brigade, NPCC and Pelandok Scout units.

April: Celebrating the Heroes of Our Lives at Book Week
-------------------------------------------------------

![bookweek.gif](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/bookweek.gif)  

By Ms Darrell Keziah Foo

Heroes Read Indeed! This year’s Book Week, a collaboration between the English Department at Foundation Programme Academy and the library, celebrated and remembered the efforts of both staff and students who actively involved themselves in this grand and epic adventure of reading. Book Week kicked off with a promotional video with a few teaching staff unreservedly sharing their views on what defines or makes a hero as well as who their favourite and personal heroes are and why. Book Week was replete with activities, satisfying the reading palette of all book enthusiasts, particularly those who were particularly fond of legends, folklores and myths. The activities available were diverse and exciting - ranging from online creative writing competitions to Class Readathon, Reading Challenge and Intra-Class Word Games just to name a few; all of which were enough to whet the appetite of both avid and less enthusiastic readers alike.

  

Three distinguished local writers - namely, Mr Felix Cheong and Ms Shamini Flint and Claire Leow - were also invited over the course of the week to talk about their respective works and where they drew inspiration from. These speakers drew roaring applause from their audience via their zoom sessions for their brilliant sharing. Book Week 2021 ended on a heroic note, with our readers emerging triumphant and richer in their literary quest.

April: SJI Remembers Former Josephian - Mr Peter Martens
--------------------------------------------------------

The SJI family is saddened at the passing of Mr Peter Martens, former student and teacher on 6 April.

  

Mr Martens (Class of 1952) was a teacher in SJI for many years. He was a revered hockey coach and he also taught Mathematics, English and Literature. He is remembered by many of his former students for his mentorship, the inspiration he imparted to the players, his wit, and his tireless love for the sport.

  

His former students, all hockey players, established the "Peter Martens Trophy" to honour their former coach. It is to be given annually to a Year 1-2 student-athlete who has excelled outstandingly well in his sport at the National level. The award was first given out in 2019. Mr Martens presented this award at&nbsp;[our Thanksgiving Ceremony](https://www.sji.edu.sg/news-and-events/news-highlights/2019#_ptoh_88396)&nbsp;in 2019.

[![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48983610828_86b5455503_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/48983610828/in/album-72157711560226967/)  

Today, we mourned a Josephian who heard the call of his Alma Mater and returned to SJI to teach and passed on the SJI tradition to many of his students, including a number of us who are presently serving in SJI. Mr Martens is remembered fondly for his humour and his smile - it could light up a whole class with smiles after the Discipline Master then dressed down a class.

  

Eternal rest, grant unto Mr Peter Martens, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.

April: Keeping the Faith Alive Through the Liturgical Seasons
-------------------------------------------------------------

![catholic.gif](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/catholic.gif)  

Lent is the most important liturgical season for Catholics. Together as a faith community, Josephians embarked on the 40-day Lenten journey to reflect on the life and Passion of Christ that culminated in the final celebration of His resurrection on Easter Sunday. Although our spirits and activities were dampened by the ongoing pandemic and social distancing measures put in place, the Catholics persevered in faith and service to the community throughout the season of Lent. We began the Lenten season on 17 February with an Ash Wednesday service at 3 locations across the school. Weekly Lenten reflections by Fr Danker were shared during our daily morning prayer. Josephians also conducted prayers of the Stations of the Cross in small groups. The school also launched three Lenten projects across different levels, where Josephians contributed food, digital devices for learning and other daily essentials for the underprivileged beyond our community. The Palm Sunday Mass was also celebrated for students after their Year 5 Day of Recollection.

  

On the evening of Maundy Thursday, as part of Lenten observance, Catholic students and staff celebrated the Eucharist in school. The atmosphere was solemn and sombre as Catholics recollected the night of the Last Supper before the Passion of the Lord on Good Friday. After the Eucharist, 22 students from the Legion of Mary (Queen of All Saints praesidium), together with Mr Bernard Teo and Mr Dominic Ang made a pilgrimage on foot to the Church of St Joseph (Bukit Timah) to mark the Year of St Joseph as proclaimed by Pope Francis.

  

During the 13-kilometres walk to the Church that took about 2 hours, the students in small groups of 4 or 5 reflected on the Stations of the Cross. They took time to relate the theme of each Station with their daily life and conversed with one another about this as part of their reflection. When they arrived on the grounds of the church, they were met by Fr Edward Seah, who imparted his blessings.

  

Ian Lee (LE201) from the Queen of All Saints praesidium shared, "_This night-walk on Maundy Thursday was really an enriching experience, both for my Catholic faith as well as the bonding between me and my fellow legionnaires, as we were able to pray in a meaningful manner in a serene environment, as well learn more about the lives and struggles of the people around me. To me, this is a completely new experience and such a step-up from my Year One, where we could not have these activities last Easter. I am glad I stayed on to experience this with my friends._

_One part that was really meaningful during our walk together with Mr Bernard Teo was the sharing of our experiences. I had the opportunity to express my opinion and impart some knowledge and wisdom to the Y1s. I could sense the strong faith when everyone prayed together, including Mr Teo. When I joined SJI, I really didn’t know I would be able to experience this with my schoolmates and I am thankful for God, who has worked through the admins of SJI to get us together like this. Hopefully, we can have more experiences like this together, especially with the lively Y1s_."

March: SJI Military Band Showcases Their Talents at SYF Band Competition
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Team A from our SJI Military Band participated in the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival Band Competition on 29 March. They overcame the odds and performed brilliantly!

  

All of last year they couldn't rehearse together because of the pandemic. They practised in sections. They practised online virtually. They practised not knowing if they would ever perform on stage or compete again. Today they did. Their rendition of 'Starlight' was simply inspired!

  

Team B performs on 7 April. We pray for an equally fantastic performance. All the best!

During the course of their research, two scientists from A\*STAR under the Scientist-In-School (SIS) Programme - Dr Judice Koh and Dr Low Joo Leng, acted as consultants to answer their questions via Google Classroom during the COVID-19 lockdown. Besides the two scientists, the science teachers who were involved in mentoring the students include Mr Raymond Wong, Ms Tan Sia Hui, Mrs Josephine Lee, Ms Gina Tan, Ms Kassandra Lim and Dr Sergei Prokopenko. Our lab technicians, Mr Raymond Fontelera, Ms Jennifer Sia and Ms Denyse Beh were of immense help to the boys in helping them with the equipment and materials that they needed.

March: SJI EAS Day
------------------

By Mrs Shirley Foo  
The SJI EAS team had its first bonding event for 2021 on 16 March, where they had to complete an SJI Amazing Race. Grouped into small teams, they were given 20 activities such as identifying significant statues around the school campus and taking group pictures at certain landmarks around the school. They were also tasked to explore the various learning facilities located at the various classroom blocks. Although tired after the almost 2-hour activity, the staff got to know each other better as well as discovered new areas within the school.

March: Catholic Education Conference 2021
-----------------------------------------

By Fr Adrian Danker, SJ  

How do educators and students in our 35 Catholic schools mark the 200th year of Catholic presence in Singapore?

  

With a day in God’s holy presence and with each other. To pray in gratitude for the gift of Catholic education. To reflect with faith on the graced encounter with Jesus in Catholic schools. To learn in humility how to help everyone in school experience God’s gift of Himself. This year’s Catholic Education Conference expressed these hopes with its theme, “Celebrating, Encountering and Creating our God Experience.”

  

The Pre-Conference Novena, the workshops on praying with art, origami and film, and the sharing of schools’ best practices to make schools holy ground to encounter Jesus and know God were some conference highlights. Archbishop William Goh invited Catholic schools to mediate a personal encounter with Jesus for everyone, and so, “ignite and shine with faith.”

  

All of this was done online, broadcasted from SJI to all the Catholic schools, where the school teams participated by observing safer management guidelines. Besides ICT support, SJI also contributed to the conference's success in various ways: from recording the Mass to designing the conference logo by Mr Michael Ee to working on the conference programme.

March: Josephians Host Visitors from MOE JC-SM2 Special Integration Programme
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

![MOE JC-SM2 Special Integration Programme1.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/MOE%20JC-SM2%20Special%20Integration%20Programme1.jpg)

By Dana Cheng (ML 512) and Torance Tan (LE508)

  

International Education (IE) is integral in today's education to provide students with international mindedness, see the world, and gain the internationalisation experience so vital in today's borderless and interconnected world. In this respect, the hosting of overseas visitors provides Josephians with an opportunity to be engaged at a global level in three areas; physical challenges, intercultural understanding and community service. This transformative curriculum hopes to lead students to learn through community engagement and connections. In SJI, IE provides the platform to nurture Josephians to become curious and passionate learners who create purposeful connections between learning and effective leading and service.

  

As part of the SJI IE Programme, 14 Year 5 Josephians organised and hosted Senior Middle 2 (SM2) students from China on 13 March 2021, under the Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme as part of the JC Experiential Programme (JXP) organised by MOE. The Josephians brought their Chinese visitors on a guided walking exploration tour in the Tiong Bahru heritage area. Through this, the Chinese students had the opportunity to visit and explore Singapore's heritage places and learn about our local culture and history. This was observed with strict safe management measures while conducting the tours.

![MOE JC-SM2 Special Integration Programme2.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2021/MOE%20JC-SM2%20Special%20Integration%20Programme2.jpg)

Through this programme, the students were reminded of the importance of people-centeredness, especially in Singapore as a city-island state. This experience has made them more aware of the importance of bilateral ties between countries and the necessity for Singapore as an island nation to maintain good relations with the countries around us. This exchange has given them the opportunity to interact, get to know, and gain a deeper insight into another culture.

March:&nbsp;Lasallian Formation Day
------------------------------

![](https://mcusercontent.com/5a4e6ac7befec103309d4c2d1/_compresseds/5800aa2f-a514-4c8d-bbb6-94eec1014ab7.jpg)

By Mr Karl Lee  
The Lasallian community held our annual Lasallian Formation Day (LFD) on 12 March 2021. The main feature of this year’s LFD was for all staff from the local Lasallian schools to comprehend and align with their respective schools' work plans to the focus articulated in the following documents:  
1\. Declaration on the Lasallian Educational Mission  
2\. Identity Criteria for the Vitality of Lasallian Educational Ministries  
  
With the safe management measures in place, the SJI community teamed up in small groups to engage in deep discussion and reflected on the different criteria from these documents. The discussions were rich and many contributed towards clarifying and strengthening our understanding of the main points of the abovementioned documents.  
  
As observed by one of our teaching staff, Ms Lee Siew Lian: “I find this year's programme so much better than the previous years. The small group discussions allowed us to take time to reflect and share our views coherently. I also find myself learning from the sharing from teachers in the other academies.

By Genevieve Heng Chin Xuen (LE610)  
On 1 and 3 March, the SJI YoungXHush organised Quali-Tea Time, an event that provided Year 6 students with a space to dedicate some time to themselves.  
  
In light of the stressful EETOKIA period, the time provided a chance for friends to relax by enjoying a cup of tea or appreciating artworks that were set up to focus on mental health. Year 6s were even encouraged to write positive and wholesome notes to each other that were pasted on a ‘wholesome wall’. The art gallery consisted of artwork done by students,&nbsp;**Sunith**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Genevieve**&nbsp;from FN604 and LE610 respectively. Alongside these artworks were poems created by the students of the Literacy Society,&nbsp;**Tricia Sin**&nbsp;(FN605),&nbsp;**Gillian Rae Ang**&nbsp;(ML611) and&nbsp;**Ashley Munoz**&nbsp;(FN601). In addition, members of YoungXHush created infographics to raise awareness of issues among the student body such as academic burnout and how to handle them.  
  
Although the event was fairly short, it was well-received, with a sizable number of students using the space to relax and destress! Through this Quali-Tea Time, Josephians recognised the importance of mental wellness by creating a space to help students whose mental health may have been on the decline.

February: Service to the Community to mark World Scouts Day
-----------------------------------------------------------

By Christian Lee (FN301)  
World Scout Day (22 February) celebrates the International Scouting Movement, and the anniversary of the birth of the founder of Scouting, Lord Robert Baden-Powell. The way to celebrate this day is to give back to the school. This year the SJI Scouts helped to clean the canteen and some common areas for a couple of days. With the belief that many hands make light work, many scouts chipped in to clean the canteen, which made it so much easier for the few cleaners who have to clean the whole school daily.  
  
Christian Lee shared, "We were glad we were able to lighten the load of the cleaners. I hoped it helped the cleaners and this also helped us realise how difficult it must be to clean the school and we should not take the school’s cleanliness for granted."

February: Commemorating Total Defence Day
-----------------------------------------

By Ms Wang Binxi

SJI commemorated Total Defence Day with a series of activities to help students understand how as Josephians, they can play their part in upholding the different pillars of Total Defence. With the theme centred on “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”, Josephians were reminded of how collective efforts can help overcome grave challenges. This is particularly pertinent in view of the nation’s fight against COVID-19.  
  
Josephians shared their part in Nation Building, from blood donation to being vigilant in fact-checking as well as teachers who served in their respective appointments in SAF to defend Singapore. We hope that students understand that Total Defence is a living concept, vital and necessary to help Singapore rise through the challenges we face. The commemoration ended with Nathanael Sutjiutama (FN605) and Tricia Phua (LE608), President and Vice-President of the Senior Council, reading out the Total Defence Day message by Minister for Defence, Dr Ng Eng Hen.  
  
Through the Josephian Formation Programme (JFJ), Josephians learnt about Total Defence Day from various activities conducted for the different levels by the Citizenship Education Committee carried out during the Total Defence Week:

  

The Year 1s played a game of 'Snake and Ladder' to reinforce what Psychological and Social Defence actions entail, followed by writing a Pledge Card of actions they can carry out in their daily lives to keep Singapore safe and secure.

![](https://mcusercontent.com/5a4e6ac7befec103309d4c2d1/images/bc1a0a4e-c1f6-4289-a4df-31e165026c1d.jpg)  

  

Year 2s played a strategy card game of ‘Guardians of the City II’ to help them develop a deeper understanding of Singapore's security threats through role-taking to keep their citizens safe against a terrorist threat.

In the post-game reflection activity, Nathanael Koh, LE203 wrote:

"We can be Men for Others and help those who are in need. During an economic crisis, there will be a cut down on food or water supply. For those who are financially weaker and not able to well afford the increased prices, we should help them by buying food for them or sharing a portion of our food with them."

  

Year 3s designed a digital clip to advocate for Singaporeans to put Total Defence into action. Congratulations to the winning classes for the following competitions!

  

**Year 3 Video Making Competition, incorporating different pillars of Total Defence and Traits of Josephians**

*   **MN303: Total Defence Day 2021- Digital Defence ([view their video](https://youtu.be/FwRUuEYJ5xA))**

In this current era, digital defence is especially important when it comes to keeping us Singaporeans safe online. According to statistics, online scams have been the most committed crime in Singapore for the past few years, with a spike last year, 2020. With this, we have to cherish and continue to uphold digital defence in our everyday lives as a pillar of strength, to protect Singapore from cyber attacks in the future.

  

*   **FN303: Defending in Community ([view their video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13QqmY1uyhQ4SlfzDMnyPDs4p4NlJqAA9/view?usp=sharing))**

The Total Defence pillar being addressed is Civil Defence. A student falls over the edge of the railing and lands onto the ground floor when playing with his wallet. However, nobody cared and stopped to help him. Then, the clock is rewound and this time, everyone plays their part to help the fallen boy by alerting everyone else to come to his aid. They are bonded by the community during times of crisis. The Josephian Profile is "Community Builder".  
  
Year 4 Freeze Frame Challenge on how SAF will look like in the students' time:  
The Year 4s, who will be serving the National Service in 2 years’ time, examined how SAF has transformed over the years and used their creativity to do up a Freeze Frame on how they think SAF will look like in their time.

  

*   **ML401**&nbsp;\- Caption: In this day and age, the world has become more digitised. Many threats have emerged from the Web. It is our duty to be more focused on these threats during our National Service, such as Cyber Defenders.

To welcome the Year of the Ox, the Chinese New Year Committee planned an array of activities for all staff and students to enjoy and immerse themselves in the celebratory mood of the Lunar New Year. From lantern making to paper cuttings, Josephians decked the isles and classrooms in spring festivity and tradition. Josephians also had a chance to partake in Chinese Couplets Writing (挥春) at the Foyer. The musically-inclined also submitted their CNY music videos to participate in our Singing Competition.  
  
On the eve of CNY, the Josphian community gathered in their classrooms for the CNY virtual celebration hosted by Koh Kai Jun Kavan (ML402) and Kavi Rajan (ML615). Ang pows were also given to the support staff who maintain the cleanliness and security of the school.  
  
In an effort to help the less privileged celebrate the festive season, the Catholic CCA group, the Society of St Vincent De Paul (SSVP) also appealed for Ang Pows collection from 16 to 19 Feb. The collections were donated to the elderly at Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital. The donations helped them have more pleasant celebrations during Chinese New Year while they were in the hospital.

The Inaugural Assembly marks the official start of the new academic year. Josephians gathered together again as one school community online in their classrooms to participate in the Inaugural ceremony. As the new academic year beckons, fresh opportunities abound for all students and staff and they were invited to reflect on their strengths as they wrote their hopes and aspirations for 2021. These precious handwritten notes symbolised our desire for growth and were blessed at the Inaugural Mass.  
  
In his Inaugural Address, Fr Adrian Danker, S.J. invited Josephians to imitate the example of St Joseph to care for each other in SJI in the new school year. St Joseph protected and provided for those he loved, especially, his family; Josephians must do the same, he said. He also challenged teachers and students to take care of the SJI Mission and nurture it. Our school is a tradition worth keeping not just for now but for the future.  
  
At the same event, Josephians and staff responded to the call to curate the SJI Significance. They came together to participate in a “cura” activity. “Curate” comes from the word “cura”. To curate is to “to take care of” and “to preserve it with care”. As a symbolic representation of “cura”, each class was invited to care for a plant by adding fertilizers and watering it. These potted plants from all 86 classes were then be installed at the Cura Corner, located at a wall of Block N.

By Mrs Josephine Lee  
Problem X (PX) Challenge is a new programme jointly organised by the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in 2020. The target participants are Year 2 to 4 students who demonstrate strong aptitude, passion and motivation for inquiry in Science and Mathematics. Participants will form teams of 3-4 members to work on a given complex real-world problem, seeking possible solutions for it by considering different perspectives and leveraging the knowledge of different disciplines, particularly in Science and Mathematics. The solutions proposed have to be supported by sound research, and analysis and evaluation of available data and practices.  
  
The focus for problem-solving in 2020 is the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants assumed the role of an Infectious Disease Response Team formed by Public Service, Singapore to address public concerns and allay fears based on an assessment of the outbreak trajectory. The challenge required participants to produce a video clip and an accompanying report that would offer the Singapore public an informed understanding of the COVID-19 situation at a particular juncture in time.  
  
SJI sent 2 teams of Year 4 IP students, 2 teams of Year 2 IP students and 1 team of Year 2 OP students. They were mentored by Mr Jerry Tai, Ms Doris Koh and Mrs Josephine Lee. Both the Year 4 IP teams reached the finals and obtained the Commendation Award while one of the Year 2 IP team received a Special Award.

From January to March 2020, eight Josephian Arts Programme (JAP) student designers mentored by art teacher Ms Jessica Cheng pushed their creative boundaries by exploring the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in their artistic endeavour. Evan Chong, Jeff Chan, Keagan Goh, Matthew Kang, Wesley Thng, Xu He, Quek Yiming, and Yu Ziyang (from LE202, 2020) launched an art trail on a smartphone application, which uses AR to tell the stories behind the artworks that lined the corridors of SJI.

  

Their initiative is one of the stories showcased at the&nbsp;[**Design Education Summit 2021**](https://designeducationsummit.designsingapore.org/learning-by-design#entry001)&nbsp;on 4 February.&nbsp;[**Click here to read about their AR journey**](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/teaching-and-learning-by-design)&nbsp;in the news.

The SJI spirit is one that is u Orientation Camp (OC) 2021 themed 'Aloha!' aimed to commence the incoming Year 5s' IB journey with a sense of spirit, hope and camaraderie. Though the OC had to be conducted with safe management measures in place, the Student Leaders endeavoured to showcase the unique SJI spirit and to introduce the values and motto and heritage of the school. The SJI school spirit is an integral aspect of every Josephian, and as such, the Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) hoped to inculcate the value of Community in the Year 5s and share this uplifting and meaningful experience with them, and help them to better integrate into the new chapter of their educational journey.  
  
The native Hawaiians use the word Aloha as a greeting, a farewell and an expression of love. However, Aloha is not just a word, it is an experience. It encompasses the deep care and respect that we ought to have for our surroundings, both physical and social. The acronymic meanings of Aloha are:

*   A, ala, watchful, alertness
*   L, lokahi, working with unity
*   O, oia'i'o, truthful honesty
*   H, ha'aha'a, humility
*   A, ahonui, patient perseverance

Aloha was chosen as the theme of OC2021 as it resonates with the Lasallian value of community; it also encompasses what it means to be men and women of integrity, highlighting how we should be patient, humble, honest, and have faith in others, values that are all an integral part of the Josephian family here in SJI.  
  
Throughout the OC, the Year 5s met new friends and classmates through the Information talks about the IB life, Subject and CAS booths as well as trial lessons that aim to accord them with a better idea of the IBDP syllabus and curriculum. These were paired with engaging and interactive activities to encourage bonding through games that interrelate our school values while encouraging interaction and facilitated talks within the respective OGs.

Despite that this project was conducted with the COVID-19 safe management measures in place,&nbsp;**Fan Enrui**&nbsp;(FN302),&nbsp;**Kothamasu Pranavasai Bhavesh**&nbsp;(FN302),&nbsp;**Chen Wei En James Ryan**&nbsp;(ML301),&nbsp;**Thaddeus Kuah Kiat Ray**&nbsp;(MN302), and&nbsp;**Koh Ze Rey, Ansley**&nbsp;(MN303) overcame the difficulties faced and persevered to produce the winning video. They were required to complete three tasks:  
1) Research into the topic of scam and how to prevent becoming victim to scams;  
2) Using the researched materials, the students will share with their fellow school-mates on anti-scam awareness; and  
3) The students will then create educational anti-scam video clips, which formed part of the competition.

January: Tribute to La Salle Br. Gregory Thomas Lim, and Former SJI Teacher
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SJI community is saddened by the passing of Br. Gregory Thomas Lim, FSC, on the afternoon of 18 January 2021 at Singapore. He was 96 years old and a De La Salle Brother for 77 years.

  

Bro Gregory came from a devout Catholic family of 4 brothers, of whom one was a twin brother and 4 sisters. He first taught in Singapore at St Michael's School from 1955-1960, and at SJI in 1970-1971. He returned to Singapore to teach Moral Instruction and Bible Knowledge in SJI and St Patrick's School from 1981-1990. He retired in 1996.

  

Bro Gregory was our Guest of Honour who officiated&nbsp;**[the opening of Missio 1852 on 7 August 2019](https://www.sji.edu.sg/news-and-events/news-highlights/2019#_ptoh_87602)**, with the ringing of the original brass school bell from the former SJI campus at Bras Basah Road.

“O God, by whose favour your servant, Brother Gregory, was called to the religious life and who witnessed to the message of salvation by his dedication to Christian education, grant that he may be admitted to your eternal friendship with those who have likewise zealously laboured in Your Vineyard. We ask this through Christ, our Lord. Amen.”

January: Forging New Relationships at TABA Day
----------------------------------------------

TABA, which means Together and By Association, is our Josephian way of integrating the boys into their new classes at Year 3. Through the TABA Day on 15 Jan and the Paraliturgy on 19 Jan, the boys bonded with their new classmates and Form Tutors. It was time for new friendships with their new classmates whom they will journey together in Years 3 and 4.

January: A New Beginning at Orientation 'Initium Novum'
-------------------------------------------------------

[![2021-01-15-Y1 Orientation Camp](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/65535/51048113808_80fcdf181d_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/albums/72157718688634616 "2021-01-15-Y1 Orientation Camp")

A new beginning might be something that many are desperately longing for, especially when a year-long pandemic lingers around into the new year. In preparation for the Year 1 Josphians to adapt to their new secondary school life in SJI, the SJI Peer Support Leaders and Facilitators conducted a week-long orientation programme themed 'Initium Novum' (which means a new beginning).  
  
During the week, the new Josephians met their new classmates from different schools and backgrounds within their fraternities. To survive their journey throughout the orientation, they were invited to learn and work together. It was time to form new friendships and bonds that would be filled with memories to come.  
  
The Orientation Campfire is the highlight of every Year 1 Orientation. The event with the blazing fire, chanting of the fraternity cheers and singing of the school songs unites the Y1s and their seniors as one big Josephian family. It is our way of building community spirit with the larger SJI community. It is a memorable experience for all new Josephians. For their seniors, it is a sweet reminiscence of their memories when they first joined SJI in Year 1. For the SJI staff, it is a night to remember that a new journey begins with these new Josephians entrusted to our care. This year's campfire was conducted with safe distancing measures in place.

January: Josephians Win Awards at Bilingual Youth Model United Nations Conference
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By Ms Annie Wong  
SJI fielded a team of 5 Josephians from across the 3 academies to take part in the second edition of the Bilingual Youth Model United Nations (BYMUN) conference organised by Nanyang Girls’ High School. The theme of the 2021 Bilingual Youth Model United Nations conference was “Transforming the world: Voices of Youth”. The conference aimed to provide student participants with an understanding of diplomacy and international relations while enhancing their bilingual proficiency, critical thinking skills, teamwork, and leadership abilities. It also sought to encourage diversity by providing students with the opportunity to share their perspectives, negotiate and collaborate on solutions to support the United Nations Sustainable Development goals. The SJI team -&nbsp;**Lim Yee Kiat Zachary**&nbsp;(ML403),&nbsp;**Li Shaokai**&nbsp;(ML403),&nbsp;**Choo Yi Ming**&nbsp;(FN302),&nbsp;**Huang Yaoting**&nbsp;(ML401) and&nbsp;**Goh Kai Jun Kavan**&nbsp;(ML402), were mentored by Ms Wai Pei Pin, who worked closely and tirelessly with the boys over the holidays to brainstorm and finetune the boys' presentations.  
  
Our team took home the following 3 awards:

*   **Best Delegate - Goh Kai Jun Kavan 吴楷峻**  
    Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) Council

*   **Honourable Mention - Choo Yi Ming 朱乙铭**  
    United Nations Commissions on the Status of Women (UNCSW) Council

*   **Outstanding Delegation - St Joseph's Institution**

This is truly a remarkable achievement considering it is SJI's debut at the BYMUN, which has traditionally been attended by mostly SAP schools. Not only did our students have to prepare and write position papers in English and Chinese, they also had to debate issues that are of a very high level of difficulty and complexity in both languages. Their ability to communicate so precisely in both English and Chinese, as well as their capacity for spontaneous and logical reasoning and critical thinking was an exceptional performance to watch. The achievement of the "Outstanding Delegation award", where there were only 2 awards given to school delegations, is proof of SJI's strength in linguistic and cognitive capability.

January: SJI Releases 2020 International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme Examination Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SJI congratulates our Class of 2020 for their results achieved at the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) November 2020 Examinations:

  

1.  99.3% of 272 IBDP students were awarded the International Baccalaureate Diploma, with an average score of 41 out of 45 points
2.  Eight students were awarded the prestigious Bilingual Diploma.
3.  71% of the cohort (194 students) attained at least 40 points out of 45.

  

The Class of 2020 includes 119 boys who were admitted to SJI at Secondary 1 in 2015 under the Integrated Programme. The results achieved by our Class of 2020 is evident of a trend that the SJI IBDP relates well with students who enjoyed high academic expectations from the programme. They have found joy in learning by being risk-takers who pursue their interests and passion instead of being rote-learners.

  

Fr (Dr) Adrian Danker, SJ, Principal of SJI, says “_The Class of 2020 has demonstrated how determination, effort and great faith in their ability to overcome challenges can produce good results, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the sudden move towards online learning during the Circuit Breaker period. We have witnessed the hard work put in by the students from this cohort, some of whom have attained exceptional results despite their heavy commitments in national sports and student leadership responsibilities. This Class has exemplified the very best of being a Josephian – they have studied hard, grown up well and contributed to make the school and world a better place. We are very proud of their achievements._”

  

As a Catholic and Lasallian school, SJI is committed to developing every student’s character and to helping them realize their academic potential, so that they become men and women whose education empowers them to make a positive difference in the world. The IBDP results of the 2020 cohort are an affirmation of the quality of the balanced and holistic education offered at SJI.
