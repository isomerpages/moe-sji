#### Art Collaboration with St Anthony’s Primary School (SAPS)

By Ms Joyce Teo  
  

Our Secondary 3 Art students conducted an art workshop for a group of Primary 2 and 3 students at St Anthony’s Primary School. The workshop on 31 Oct and 7 Nov were to get the participants excited about making art with unconventional materials and tools that can be easily found around us. Our boys shared different mark-making techniques and encouraged the young children to use leaves, sponges, bamboo skewers and so on, with much success.

This is what our boys had to say about the whole experience:

style="width:60%">

“When we were told to plan a workshop for Primary 2 and 3 children, everyone was stunned and could not fathom what kind of activity would be age-appropriate for them. Our plan changed constantly, we discussed often and even our final plan had its flaws. Despite our stress and frustration, it was all rewarded when we heard the children's gleeful cheers after we told them there was another session next week.

<img src="![](/images/IMG_8681.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

We learnt that in order to work with children, one has to be very patient, understanding and have a whole reservoir of energy. Furthermore, we had to be good role models. We experienced that good planning is essential for success. We realised that the key to have a successful workshop with young children was to keep them occupied with a variety of activities, not spend too long on any one activity and lastly, let them explore and let their creative juices run! Overall, the kids were extremely fun to work with and we would definitely want to work with them again!”

#### October: End of Year Thanksgiving Assembly

By Elliot Yap (MN302)  

On 27 October, SJI officially closed the academic year with a thanksgiving ceremony in the Founder’s Hall. The ceremony kicked off with the students singing the 125th Anniversary Song and Glorious Patron, as the entourage of school leaders and teachers marched in. This was followed by prayers for the school conducted by Friar Michael D’Cruz and various students from each level. Fr Adrian Danker gave a heartwarming speech, thanking the various teachers who are retiring or ending their service with the school. Students showcased their camaraderie and belted out songs such as “St. Joseph’s Call” and “We are Lasallian” in unison. All good things have to come to an end and the ceremony ended off with a farewell to our dearest teachers, as the students sang to the tunes of the school rally and “Salute to the Alma Mater” to close out the ceremony. This marked the end of the first year Josephians returned to the new Malcolm road campus, and students and teachers alike could look forward to a restful December holidays.

#### September: IB Art Grad Show - Vice Versa

<img src="![](/images/IBart3.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

By Mr Samuel Ng

The 2017 Group 6 Grad Show, Vice Versa, featuring the 13 Visual Art students and the 6 Music students from the JC2 level, took place over 2 sessions from 11 - 21 September.

  

The Training Room at the Indoor Sports Hall that was converted into a gallery for this exhibition, saw full-house attendance on both show dates.&nbsp;Guests were treated to a music recital that included a Jazz number and music from the Final Fantasy video game.&nbsp;The artist talk that followed detailed the labours of artistic creation and expression, from conception to birth, telling of tortured tales and enthralling epiphanies.&nbsp;Finally were the guests allowed into the hallowed enclave of each artist's private world. There they were invited to pause, to reflect, and to empathise.&nbsp;The spectrum of art forms and media engaged, from traditional oil painting to installations of mixed media and multimedia presentations, provided for an integrated sensorial experience far richer than the obligatory reception that followed, sumptuous as it was, could hope to match.

  

Such first-hand quasi-synesthetic encounters amalgamating the various palates of tastes - auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and gustatory - characteristic of every Group 6 Grad Show presentation, make this annual event a must-attend for every discerning connoisseur.

#### September: SJI BLOODay

<img src="![](/images/blooday.png)"  
style="width:60%">

On 13 September, SJI BLOODay held its annual blood drive. In collaboration with Singapore Red Cross and Health Sciences Authority, we received an overwhelming response as many Josephians expressed their interest in the altruistic act, which amounted to about 100 potential donors!

  

The stringent criteria to donate blood, however, disqualified many of the enthusiasts who were sick recently, had small veins or low haemoglobin levels. The event concluded with 49 successful donors (70% of projected collection), a laudable number in view that this was the first school-held blood donation drive since we moved back to the new campus. 2017 blood donation drive may be over, but the commitment to make a difference will continue in SJI, as the saying goes— “You don’t need to be a doctor to save lives”.

#### September: SJI Welcomes Pilgrim Image of Our Lady of Fatima

13th September 2017 is a date that will be remembered in SJI’s history, where the statue of Our Lady of Fatima visited SJI again, as it did almost 68 years ago at our former Bras Basah campus on 11 November 1950. This year, to celebrate the International Centennial Pilgrim Image of Our Lady of Fatima, SJI was greatly honoured to be the host venue for the main event when Our Lady of Fatima was in Singapore from 11 – 18 September.

  

The SJI Catholic community took upon this occasion to evangelize about Our Lady and the miracles of her apparition in Fatima, Portugal that happened a century ago. A private event was held for Josephians that afternoon, where the students organised a welcoming party for her and led the school in praying the rosary. This was followed by a Novena ran by the Josephians where a meaningful and heartfelt homily was shared by the students on how Our Lady of Fatima has and continues to touch them. Students from the five SJI Legion Praesidiums from both Secondary and JC sections took turns to keep a vigil throughout the afternoon which ended off with a unique SJI Human Rosary, before she was proceeded to the chapel.

  

A high altar was erected under the portico of the Founder, St. John Baptist de La Salle and an estimated 5,000 faithful flowed into SJI to venerate the Pilgrim Virgin that evening. Archbishop William Goh celebrated the mass, which was followed by a candlelight procession.

#### September: Catholic Education Sunday - 10 September 2017

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore has designated 10 September 2017 as Catholic Education Sunday (CES), to give thanks for God's gift of Catholic schools and the quality education they strive to offer all students, regardless of religion, in Singapore.

#### August: SJI Teams Win 1st and 2nd Runner-ups at Raffles Business Symposium

The Raffles Business Symposium (RBS) is an annual conference that encourages manifestation of feasible business ideas by participating schools. The 2017 theme – ‘The Art of Thriving in the 4th Industrial Revolution’ prompted young entrepreneurs to analyse the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid development and commercialisation of technology. The teams were required to recognise the needs of our society in order to develop a creative solution that harnesses the technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution such as big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

<img src="![](/images/36390654362_95b09a6b57_o.png)"  
style="width:60%">

Both teams from SJI qualified for the finals, which consisted of the top 4 teams. Raphael Chew Ann Kim (JC102), Jason Sutanto (JC102), Nguyen Minh Chau (JC104), Pham Thi Huong Phuong (JC118) and Hari Menon (JC102) of Team Samaritan Syndicate proposed VISION, a sleek piece of eyewear that helps to monitor a student’s level of understanding based on the content delivered to the student in order to deliver, by way of augmented reality or an online platform, enrichment material tailored specifically for the students. The other team VSBCRV, consisted of Vedant Chauhan (JC115), Sharan Vaitheswaran (JC108), Ng Huey Min (JC110), Vanshiqa Agrawal (JC117), Brenda Tang Hui En (JC102) and Rachel Tan Si Yun (JC102). Vanshiqa of VSBCRV explains her team’s proposal, “Looking into Singapore's ageing population, we conceptualised a smart mobile chair, christened GoldLee, which is embedded with an array of sensors which monitors a user’s vitals for continuous, cheaper and more accurate healthcare. The smart chair communicates with elderly through speakers in the chair and an AR screen to enhance viewer experience.”

<img src="![](/images/35724043374_402638775d_o.png)"  
style="width:60%">

Both teams worked tirelessly in the weeks leading up to their final presentation and stood tall under the scrutiny of RBS judging panel. After an arduous but fruitful journey, SJI secured the second (VSBCRV) and third place (Samaritan Syndicate) in the competition, beating Raffles Institution and coming in behind Temasek Polytechnic.

#### August: Josephian Performs in Wonderland X concert

“Wonderland X” is a concert by TO Ensemble held on 26 August at the Esplanade Recital Studio. It commemorates the Ensemble’s 10-year endeavour to engage audiences in the discussion of environmental issues and inspire them to take actions. Among the musicians was Zhang Qintian (TG205), who is also the youngest and the only non-professional performer on stage. She was recommended by her teacher, who is the lead violinist, to play with the ensemble as a guest musician. It was through this 2-month collaboration that she learnt more about contemporary fusion music and its power to communicate and inspire.

The results of the competition on 18 August were extremely commendable, with Kai Yang and Isaac emerging as finalists, Russell attaining third place, and Anne in first place.

#### August: SJI Football CAS

The SJI ‘A’ Division (boys) team prepared a group of non-A Div players to compete in the CJC challenge Cup 2017. This is a football tournament organized by CJC to give players who were not able to participate in the ‘A’ division tournament, an opportunity to play in a competitive environment. Many of our boys who came forward for this tournament had never received formal football training before and had only two months to prepare for the tournament. During this period, our ‘A’ division team saw these boys grow from a group of enthusiastic but raw individuals into a tightly knit and fearless unit that refuses to acknowledge when the odds are against them. The boys fought hard and fairly against traditional powerhouses like RI and ACJC and finished in 3rd place. Though the team was disappointed at not finishing in the finals, our opponents and critics have remarked that the team had bowed out with their heads held high based on their performance.

<img src="![](/images/CJC%20tournament%203rd%20Place.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

Meanwhile, the ‘A’ Division team continued their preparations for next year’s competition with three friendlies in Term 3. Formed only in 2017, they began with a 6-1 win over ACS(I) on 1 August. Three days later, the team beat Tampines JC with 2-1. Finally, SJI rounded off the term with a 2-0 win against Millenia Institute on 16 August.

  

The SJI Women’s Football, having only started in March this year, have been actively involved in a number of friendlies, as a way of gaining exposure and to hone their newly learned skills as novices. After 3 months of preparation, they played a friendly match against RI on 24 May that ended with a 3-2 loss. This was followed by another friendly against HCI (and its alumni) on 19 July, but were beaten with a score of 5-1. These losses compelled them to reflect on their journey thus far and what they wanted to achieve from this CAS. Their teachers and coach as well as their opponents shared that they were a team with great potential, as they were able to hold their own against well-established and experienced teams in the ‘A’ division.

<img src="![](/images/SJI%20Woccer%20vs%20RI%20Girls.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

Inspired by such sharing, they affirmed that they wanted to make the most of their time in SJI and fight for something meaningful. They have committed to compete in ‘A’ division 2018. Under the guidance of their coach and teachers, they trained harder and more strategically, with belief and with passion. In August, the girls participated in two friendlies against TPJC and MI. Despite being a modest squad of 13, they held the bigger and more experienced teams to thrilling draws. These results have only whetted their appetite and they are hungry for more success. The team welcomes more girls who have the warrior’s spirit to join them as they prepare to take on the challenges ahead.

Our SJI Football team welcomed guests from St Joseph's College (Hong Kong) on 18 August with two friendly games that involved the Under-14 and U-17 teams. The 30-minute matches played within two halves exhibited both grit and aggression from both parties who were keen to stamp their marks on the games. In the end, our U-14 team emerged victorious, winning the game 3-0 while our U-17 team lost their game with a score of 2-1. Our U-17 team, which comprised of mainly our Secondary 3 students, fought well to match the physicality and aggression of their U-17 opponents. The matches concluded with exchanges of hugs and handshakes, in the true spirit of sportsmanship.

#### August: National Education Dialogue with Mr Poon Hong Yuen, CEO of SPRING Singapore

<img src="![](/images/IMG_1357.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

Do you know how many Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are there in our Singapore economy and how much it contributes to our economy?

  

Our JC1 teachers and students had the privilege to engage in a dialogue session with Mr Poon Hong Yuen, CEO of SPRING Singapore on 18 August. During the session, both teachers and students actively discussed about some issues relating to entrepreneurship and innovation in the Singapore economy. Some issues such as the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our economy were discussed and students were concerned about how this development will eventually affect the employment in Singapore, as the economy advances into these different areas.

  

On a lighter note, Mr. Poon candidly shared about his conversation with his teenage son and gave some timely advice to our JC1 students. Both the teachers and students took away valuable insights from the dialogue and enjoyed their discussion with Mr. Poon.

A test of one’s endurance in the form of long-distance running, Josephians donning fraternity colours had to run the shorter 3.6km (for lower Secondary boys and JC girls) or the longer 4.3km track (for upper Secondary and JC boys) around the scenic reservoir. Throughout the run, participants were surrounded by the beauty of nature and treated to a picturesque view of the reservoir’s calm waters as they jogged under a blanket of shade provided by numerous trees lining the perimeters of the reservoir. Although the run was tough and arduous, most Josephians still gave their all and completed the race, with many receiving the Finisher’s Medal as the reward for their efforts. After the culmination of this year’s meet, everyone headed home feeling tired yet satisfied, knowing that they had finished the race and could now rest and enjoy the break that would come with the National Day holiday on the next day.

The Secondary 2 Day of Recollection was held in SJI Junior on 5 August. Based on the theme “Transfigured Me”, the boys gathered in the morning in preparation for the Feast of the Transfiguration, which fell on a weekend this year. A little short prayer they prayed and shared during the Eucharistic celebration:  
  

“We pray for our faith, that we can be more faithful to God and commit less sin. We pray for our parents, that they may be good parents and help us as we grow up, not being too strict with us or spoil us. We pray for our friends, that we will understand the true meaning of friendship, that we will be able to get true friends that will stay by our side and support us through our problems and that we will be true friends to others. Amen.”

#### August: The Individual Academic Project (IAP) Fair

By Anson Goh Jia Wei (MN203)  

<img src="![](/images/20170803_104528%20-%20MN2032017%20ANSON%20GOH%20JIA%20WEI%20(1).jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The Individual Academic Project (IAP) Fair was held on 3 August in the Founder’s Hall. All Secondary 1 to 3 IP students attended the fair to learn about the research done by our seniors in Secondary 4. This was truly an eye-opener for me, as it allowed the juniors to have a preview of the life of a Secondary 4 IP student.

  

One of my seniors, Devvrat from MN401, researched on the growth of bacterial microbes in the body and that led him to develop yogurt as a product which he brought to the fair for visitors to try. Although it did not look appealing, it was fairly delicious and nutritious. This was achieved with ingredients such as avocados, and bananas. His mentor, Mr Genesius Chan, provided guidance along the way, as Devvrat worked independently to complete his assignment.

  

Basil Tan (FN403) created a simple yet intelligent device to aid the growth of a toddler’s motor skills. A child could control a Lego car through a phone connected by sensors to the car to develop motor skills by playing a simple car driving game. Despite the idea is simple, it is very useful in the development of necessary skills of a toddler or growing child. Overall, this was an extraordinary exhibition with wonderful projects that blew the minds of students.

#### July: Josephians and Rafflesians Meet at Annual Ortega Cup

Embodying the essence of team spirit, sportsmanship and a history of friendship with Raffles Institution, this year marks the 11th edition of the Ortega Cup, which was held on 28 July at SJI International. We were blessed with good weather, end-to-end action and great camaraderie.

  

**The Under-16s**

<img src="![](/images/U16.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The event started off with a pulsating and breathtaking U-16s match that saw our young Josephians play with great tactical discipline and finesse. A close range shot made it 1-0 in the first half but the Raffles team didn’t take this lying down. They were rewarded with a goal that brought the game level at 1-1 when the Raffles striker made a rare break into the penalty box and slotted the ball under the goalkeeper’s arms. The goalkeeper kept the game intact by denying a subsequent Rafflesian penalty. The boys left it late and eventually overcame the Raffles defence once more in the second half, with a thumping shot into the far right of the goal.

  

Final score:&nbsp;**SJI 2 - Raffles 1**

  

**The Over-40s**

<img src="![](/images/O-40s.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The O-40s match followed thereafter and we were entertained with nail-biting action throughout the game. Both sides wore their heart on their sleeves and were keen to win the Suhaimi Ali Cup; more so for the SJI O-40s team as they look to take the cup back from the Rafflesians. With the oldest team member just a year short from 60 and several of them in their fifties, the SJI O-40s team led by Captain Dr Ooi Lai Hock (Class of 1986) showed great energy and team spirit throughout the game. Clever gameplay and overlapping runs down the wings from both sides saw some near misses but all was level at the end of game. As the visiting school, the Raffles O-40s team was awarded the winner of this game.

  

Final score:&nbsp;**SJI 0 - Raffles 0**&nbsp;(visiting school wins)

  

**The Under-40s**

<img src="![](/images/U-40s.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

Winning against the brilliant Raffles U-40s team for the first time at the last Ortega Cup, the SJI U-40s team was determined to win their counterparts for the second year running. Led by Captain Ang Siong Guan (Class of 2003), several of the winning team members returned to play alongside with new entrants. The SJI U-40s fired its cylinders and came agonisingly close to scoring on many occasions but all came to naught at the end of the first half, as the Raffles defence stood strong.

  

Winning important balls all around the pitch, the SJI U-40s continued its barrage of attacks against the strong Raffles defence. The defence was finally overwhelmed and a glancing header off a wonderfully taken corner put SJI up 1-0. This invigorated the Raffles U-40s team and they came firing thereafter. The SJI team however held strong to the lead they have right to the end, showing grit and resolve.

  
Final score:&nbsp;**SJI 1- Raffles 0**

#### July: Josephians Celebrate SJI's 165th Anniversary

Josephians from all walks of life came together to celebrate SJI’s 165th Anniversary at the Fairmont Hotel on 22 July.

  

SJI has been blessed for 165 years, to have the support of the De La Salle Brothers to educate generations of Josephians since 1852. It was from SJI that the De La Salle Brothers built up the family of Lasallian schools in Singapore.

  

It is also a time for all to reflect on the value of Lasallian education that has shaped generations of students from St Joseph’s Institution, St Patrick’s School, St Anthony’s Primary School, De La Salle Primary School, SJI Junior (formerly St Michael’s School), St Stephen’s School and SJI International to become men and women of integrity, and men and women for others.

  

Over 880 donors, alumni, and former teachers attended the gala dinner, who were enthralled by highly entertaining performances by FIVERA, a Thai pop‐opera group. The event raised more than $570,000 for the school’s building fund.

#### July: SJI Celebrates Racial Harmony Day

SJI commemorated Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on 21 July, the same day when the 1964 Race Riots took place 53 years ago. The emphasis for this year’s RHD is our journey from tolerating differences to embracing diversity, as our Singapore identity continues to develop. It reflects the harmonious relationship we try to instill in every Josephian as well as in the wider community. With the support of the Parent Support Group (PSG) and the Senior and Secondary Student Councils, an old-school-themed carnival was held at the school Foyer during break time with cultural games and food stalls prepared especially to forge Racial Harmony within our community this day.

#### July: FRENCH DAY 2017

By Anshiqa Agrawal and Russell Koh

  

Bonjour Mes Amis! (Hello my friends!)

style="width:60%"> 

SJI celebrated the French National Day on 14 July, with an event organised by French teacher Mr Jean Paul Heusdens, the French Ab Initio and French club students from the Senior section. The school foyer was transformed into a vibrant plethora of engaging posters all about French Culture, designed by the students, and the tempting aroma of baked French Cuisine by the Culinary Club invited many to pop by and join in the celebration. C’était délicieux!

<img src="![](/images/fullsizeoutput_7b2.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

There were also many entertaining performances by the Vocapella CAS, Hannah, Phuong, and Ms Elizabeth Mosbergen. Informative booths held by organisations such as the Swiss Embassy, the Belgium Embassy and the French Chamber of Commerce, also enlightened students about higher education in countries of Europe. The day concluded with an interaction session with Singaporean French-speaking alumni for JC1 students at the LT.

#### July: One Week, Many Stories

By Lucius Yeo, Chong Jin Qi and Ridley Leong (FN202)

<img src="![](/images/FN203%20ready%20to%20perform.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The annual English Book Week was held from 10 – 14 July and saw the students come forth to participate in various English activities. FN202 and LE203 squared off during the Inter-class Taboo competition. Taboo tests one’s description skills and enriches one’s vocabulary. Students had fun guessing words from the given clues. With two games played simultaneously in both classrooms, FN202 was victorious by winning both games at home and away turf. It was indeed a close fight!

  

Through verses, students from ML201 and MN201 partook in a poetry slam battle. Puns and rhymes were just a few of the countless poetic devices utilized. At times of witty words, excitement followed. At times of weighty words, a pensive silence was observed. The tutors carried out careful consideration and the results were to be released at a later date.

<img src="![](/images/Macbeth%20posters%20by%20various%20S2%20classes.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

Students also displayed their talents by presenting the art of acting, script writing and directing. They acted upon the treason, treachery and tyranny of Macbeth. Alden and Xuan Han from FN203 commented, “It was also a matter of confidence and voice projection. As a whole, this Macbeth performance helped us to develop both holistically and intellectually”. Together with LE201, these students had the opportunity to spar their acting skills in front of an audience, bringing their weeks of preparation and rehearsals to fruition and the delight of the audience. Not forgetting an exhibition booth in the library that showcased all the creative posters by the Secondary Two students.

<img src="![](/images/Figuring%20out%20words%20and%20more%20words.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The week was nearing its end when 10 student ambassadors went on a secret mission to spot readers in the SJI community. Known as the “Spot-A-Reader Campaign”, SJI collaborated with the National Library Board to run this event to promote reading among youth. The ambassadors went about spotting avid readers and rewarding them with prizes for their endeavour. Although the number of readers spotted on the first day were low, the numbers surged on Day Two when teachers holding books were ambushed at the Annex.

  

In all, the week had whizzed past and the activities came to a close. As student reporters, we are very happy to be able to capture these moments in SJI that made school life so much more enriching. In fact, we believe that the students involved in these activities certainly would have their own stories to tell as well.

#### July: Josephians Go On Annual Pilgrimage to Mount Carmel

It is a treasured privilege to be invited by the Carmelite Sisters to join in their annual celebration for the Feast of Mount Carmel. This annual pilgrimage is a unique relationship the Josephians have with the Carmelite community in Singapore. To prepare the Josephians for this Feast, the Carmelites from St John of the Cross Community including their Superior, Fr. Ferdinand, Bro. Moses and the postulants; Jeremy, Bernady, Joseph, Raphael, Michael, Francis, and Daniel – shared about the charism of the Carmelites. Josephians as a school community, prayed as well as offered their service as a choir for the Eucharistic Celebration in the Carmelite Convent Chapel.

Out of Time performing at SJI's homecoming event in January 2017  
  

Formed in 2014 when they were just in secondary 2, Out of Time’s Justin Alfonso S Pansacola (JC 103), Tyrone Santiago (JC 103), Chia Jeng Yee (JC 103) were exploring pop punk music. They did not succeed well in early auditions as they were still finding themselves as a band. Since then, the band has grown to include drummer Wells Chin Shijian (JC 106) and bassist Justin Tan (JC 116). Just as they have increased in strength, their music also found its voice. In the VOMG 2017 – ‘a showcase and competition for junior college bands’ on 13 June, Out of Time was rewarded with a first runner up position. “We weren’t expecting to win. We thought we didn’t stand a chance,” said Justin Pansacola.

They have certainly come a long way. From not being able to find time to practise (hence, their band’s name) to the many disagreements they have had; they have an achievement to be proud of. Out of Time will be performing at the SJI 165th Anniversary Gala Dinner on 22 July 2017.

#### July: Sweet Victory at Social Innovation Relay

<table style="margin: auto; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; clear: both; border: 1px solid transparent; table-layout: fixed;" class="ive_eobj_center ives_tab_kosong"><tbody style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><tr style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><td style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 15px 15px 0px; vertical-align: top; width: 337.633px;"><img style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px; border: none; float: left;" class="ive_eobj_left" alt="SIR-Chaleur Phuong Ha, Ezekiel, Jonathan, Thaddeus.jpg" width="100%" src="![](/images/SIR-Chaleur%20Phuong%20Ha,%20Ezekiel,%20Jonathan,%20Thaddeus.jpeg)"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;">Chaleur: Ezekiel, Phuong Ha, Jonathan, Thaddeus</td><td style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 15px 15px 0px; vertical-align: top; width: 337.641px;"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; outline: none; padding: 0px; border: none; float: right;" class="ive_eobj_right" alt="SIR-Rushe Chantel, Jia Ying, Anshiqa, Sean.jpg" width="100%" src="![](/images/SIR-Rushe%20Chantel,%20Jia%20Ying,%20Anshiqa,%20Sean.jpeg)"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;">Rushe: Chantel, Jia Ying, Anshiqa, Sean</td></tr></tbody></table>

A clean sweep – that was what SJI did in the recent Social Innovation Relay (SIR) competition organised by Junior Achievement Europe and supported by Nationale-Nederlanden Group. As part of PRISM (the social enterprise club in the senior section) our two teams: Chaleur and Rushe emerged champion and first runner up for the national competition on 2 July 2017 respectively. At the international arena, Chaleur representing Singapore could not do any better by overcoming the other nine teams to claim victory on 21 June 2017.

  

This is no mean feat considering this year, over 10,000 students across 10 countries were involved in the 7th edition of SIR. Teams taking part are challenged to develop feasible and innovative business concepts that solve social problems.

  

Rushe, comprising Anshiqa Agrawal (JC 108), Sean Koh (JC103), Lim Jia Ying (JC117) and Chantel Lee (JC113), presented Tribus, an innovative recycling bin that can automatically sort different types of waste and incentivize users for doing so. Thaddeus Lee (JC117), Ezekiel Ang (JC117), Jonathan Audie Widjaja (JC108) and Tran Nguyen Phuong Ha (JC117) forming Chaleur, decided to support students, especially those from lower income households, to take charge of their education through a one-stop learning e-platform. This concept took the standard Q&amp;A platform and enhanced it with a social networking aspect, and made revenue through partnerships with businesses to provide coupons for the students.

  

As part of their hard earned efforts, Chaleur will be flying to Prague from 30 Aug to 4 Sept to participate in the JA Alumni Europe Annual Conference.

#### July: Scout Jamboree in Mongolia

By K Preneel (MN201)  

<img src="![](/images/CIMG1491.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

Over a period of 7 days from July to August, three Pelandok Scouts - Elkan Chan (MN201), Lim Yan Kai Benjamin (ML201) and K Preneel (MN201) attended the 31st Asian Pacific region Scout Jamboree in Mongolia. The Scout Jamboree can be broken down into three parts: International Friendship module, leisure time and important events.

  

The International Friendship module is where the scouts learn about the way the Mongolians live, and interacted with the scouts from different countries to understand each other’s culture, especially the culture in Mongolia. When there are any pockets of leisure time, the scouts would play games with the Mongolian scouts or tour other contingents’ campsites.

<img src="![](/images/mg.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The Singapore contingent also traded badges with the scouts of other nations, taking the opportunity to get to know each other and exchange contacts. The Singapore scouts also had a chance to play soccer and even do traditional Mongolian wrestling with the Mongolian scouts. There was a Cultural Festival day where all the different contingents cooked their traditional dishes and showcase it to all the scouts of different nations.

#### July: I am loved by God, #EncounteredGod

<img src="![](/images/IMG_0480.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

I am loved by God, #EncounteredGod is the theme of this year’s retreat for the graduating Secondary 4 boys. They had a wonderful time experiencing God throughout the 3-day, 2-night camp in June, at St. Patrick’s School, a fellow Lasallian school. It was a spirit-filled weekend with movies based on the theme, sessions that spoke about the gift of one being blessed and loved by God even through our difficulties. This retreat was directed by the Filipino Brothers and lay partners who were professionals in their back home as campus ministers in their respective Lasallian University or High schools. The boys entered the retreat reluctant and tired, but ended with an encounter, knowing that they are truly loved by God.

Scouts from Hong Kong LaSalle College touched down on the shores of Singapore on 28 June, to learn about education in Singapore and our culture. They visited several local haunts, such as the famous Newton Hawker Centre and a shopping trip down Orchard Road, soaking in the hustle and bustle of Singapore's shopping district.

  

They also visited the Singapore Art Museum, which was the former SJI, and paid a visit to the Singapore Scout Association to learn more about how Singapore Scouting came to be and how much it has grown over the years.

To top it all off, they participated in the Lasallian Scout Camp, totalling over 100 participants from 4 different LaSalle Schools to celebrate 165 years of Lasallian education in Singapore. They also participated in various exciting Scout activities, such as outdoor cooking and games at Sarimbun. To end it all, a campfire was held where everyone sang their hearts out and basked in the campfire as one Lasallian community.

#### June: A Brand New Experience at ORP Vietnam 2017

By Mark Caleb Chan (MN401)

On 22 May 2017, a group of Sec 4 IP students took off on a plane to the rustic plains of Vietnam. Some were looking for something to check off their resume, while others just wanted to have some fun. All got far more than they bargained for.

<img src="![](/images/ORP%20Vietnam%202017.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The first week was spent in the heart of Hanoi, surrounded by the opulence of the best Vietnam had to offer. It was a first-hand experience and an eye opening reflections for many. Under the dedicated eye of the teachers and the hospitable care of the student hosts from Vin School, SJI students had a whale of a time, trying out many exotic Vietnamese dishes such as the renowned vegetable wrapped spring roll, and green bean cake. The second and third day saw the SJI students serving at Thuy An Rehabilitation Center, with opportunities to hoe the ground, try their hand at local handicrafts and interact with children through football and bowling, showing once again the timeless and universal nature of service. We spent our third and fourth days mingling with the locals and getting to know first-hand the ancient and intricate culture of the Vietnamese. Whether haggling over items or visiting famous Vietnamese landmarks like Ho Chinh Minh Memorial or prisons where the colonial French's influence is still clearly felt till today, the students found many meaningful relationships, and widened their worldview in just a few days. It all culminated in a stunning prom night on the fifth day, where everyone got down to dance to the beat of famous Vietnamese DJs. Throughout the amazing and fun experiences, there were reflection sessions for the students to internalise what they learnt and to share their stories in their group discussions.

<img src="![](/images/Time%20for%20a%20break.png)"  
style="width:60%"> 

In the second week, we headed to Hang Kia Village, a community of farmers in the mountains of Vietnam, a place of cool climate, diverse flora and fauna and stunning natural beauty. The going got tough this week. Pushing through fatigue and muscle cramp, the boys learned the true meaning of sacrifice, and experienced the same physical labour the locals went through. We spent three days building a wall around the local school and painting the school building. This project had helped us come together as a team, working side by side with each other. Despite the hard work and the intense heat from the afternoon sun, we were determined to complete our task well. It became apparent to us the value of the newly built wall and the newly painted surroundings. Before we started, we surveyed the classroom walls and the exterior wall; they had not seen a fresh coat of paint since the day it was built. A thick layer of algae had covered the surface, making it look old and dilapidated. We could relate very well to the village students’ need for a newly painted classroom since we too had just moved to our upgraded school earlier this year. Concurrently, a group of us with some “masonry talent” set out to build a surrounding wall behind the school. This would greatly enhance the safety of the students from oncoming traffic and it was a barrier to prevent farm animals from randomly entering the school. It was challenging and backbreaking work; however, we were determined to complete it. It was sheer jubilation that the Principal of the school, and several villages watched us ceremoniously cement the last brick in place at 18:52hrs on 30 May 2017. A loud cry of “JOSEPH’S – ORA, ORA, ALL THE WAY” echoed through the mountains that evening. The local supervisor overseeing our work was very impressed and commended us for the good quality workmanship.

<img src="![](/images/IMG_4361.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

We received a special surprise on the last day in Hang Kia where we had a chance to build our own bamboo rafts. A whole pile of felled bamboo trees and several traditional tools lay in front of us, as we had to build three working rafts. It took us some time to be organised and to figure out what to do. The scouts in our group began discussions with the local raft builders and soon we were busy chopping, and sawing away at the logs of bamboo. The whole riverbank transformed into a hive of activity as we worked noisily in the serene backdrop of a quiet mountain farming village. Soon it was time to test the rafts, and a local raft operator helped to inspect our rafts for stability and safety. With a broad smile, he gave all three rafts the thumbs up. It was truly gratifying as we paddled leisurely down the river in the fully functioning rafts that we had just built. We donated the three rafts to the village, it would earn them some income from tourist rides and the money would go toward funding their community projects.

<img src="![](/images/Scenic%20Mountain%20Trail.png)"  
style="width:60%">

As we descend from the mountain, our physiques were put to the test during the brutal six-hour trek to Cun Pheo village. We carried our heavy backpacks as we headed down the seemingly endless descend, and every muscle and joint in our lower extremities were screaming in protest, as we endured a sudden heatwave with temperatures in the high forties. The frequent stops under the shady trees and a picnic by a large buffalo pond provided us the rest we needed to complete the journey. This was a first for all of us and we definitely would not complain about the extra water that we carried at the start of the trek. We consumed every precious drop.

<img src="![](/images/Ready%20to%20go.png)"  
style="width:60%">  

We returned home to Singapore three days later on 5 June 2017, tired but satisfied.&nbsp;Through this journey, we experienced personal growth with many important life lessons learnt—simplicity, hardship, adventure, the companionship of good friends and new friends. It tapped on our mental, physical, social and emotional capacities on many different levels. The events, sights, sounds and interactions with others, constantly challenge our thoughts as we begin or end each new day on the trip. As one student said, "This journey is an essential first step in an SJI student's development as a man and as a servant leader." ORP may not be easy nor convenient. However, it is worth every penny because it is more than just a trip. One that every Sec 4 student would be better off experiencing it once in a lifetime.

style="width:60%">

The SJI dragon boat team from the Senior section paddled their way to 3 bronze medals at the National Inter-Schools (A Division) Dragon Boat Championship on 2 June. Organized by the DBS Marina Regatta, it features over 82 local and international dragon boat teams, including 5 junior colleges. The race was located at the promontory @Marina Bay, surrounded in the scenic view of the CBD area. Despite the intense heat from the afternoon sun, many students came down to support and cheer on the dragon boat team. The SJI dragon boat team put up a good fight against the defending champions NJC and the other junior colleges, getting 3rd place in the DB12 and DB22 crew men 200m as well as the DB 12 crew girls 200m. It was a proud moment for the team as it was a race that they have trained hard for, making many sacrifices along the way and having to achieve a sweet and hard-earned victory at the end of the journey.

#### May:&nbsp;Josephians Enriched By Lessons Beyond the Classrooms

Our Secondary 1 – 4 students set off from SJI to various locations for Enrichment Day on 31 May, which was organised for students to experience multi-disciplinary learning and to learn beyond the confines of the classroom. Different activities were organised for each level.

  

The Secondary One boys visited Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, MacRitchie Reservoir Park and Singapore Botanic Gardens to understand the adaptation of natural vegetation in a tropical humid environment and develop the spirit of field inquiry, acquire skills in field observations, data collection, analysis and presentation.

<img src="![](/images/Police.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

Our Secondary Two boys visited the Singapore River to engage in field-based learning by forming hypothesis and constructing their understanding through observation and data and expressed their learning in History, Geography, Mathematics and Science through infotainment graphs, videos and reports.

  

To better understand and appreciate the values and customs of different cultures to build successful interpersonal relationships in a diverse environment, the Secondary Three boys had the opportunity to experience enriching and meaningful cultural modules such as calligraphy, bhangra dancing, martial arts and sepak takraw.

<img src="![](/images/Chinese%20Calligraphy.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%"> 

The Secondary Four students had a list of 14 organisations they could opt to visit so that they could learn about professions and industries that they may encounter in the future. These organisations ranged from law firms to financial institutions. During the visit, speakers provided insights to the educational qualifications, skills and dispositions required for the spectrum of jobs available in these organisations. These were followed by a tour of the work place.

<img src="![](/images/LTA.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

Caleb Chan (FN301) shared, “The Sec 3 Enrichment Day was an eye-opening experience for us. It has enabled us to learn various things away from the class and the textbooks. From the cultural activities that we participated in, we were able to appreciate and find meaning in those cultures - and its beliefs, values, and customs - which would otherwise be alien to us. As a school that hails students from many different races, finding out more about the cultures of our fellow men will help us to build better relationships among peers, due to these shared experiences.”

#### May: Endearing Performances at Heartstrings 2017

The Heartstrings Charity Concert was performed to a full-house audience on 27 May. Organised by SJI’s Social Enterprise Club, PRISM, the 2017 Charity Concert was held in aid of Beautiful Minds Charity (BMC) Singapore and Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA). Beautiful Minds is a music academy which nurtures musical talent in children with disabilities, while RDA provides free horse riding therapy session for the disabled.

<img src="![](/images/DSC00503.png)"  
style="width:60%">

The idea of the Heartstrings Concert began as a request to PRISM to help the SJI String Ensemble organise a concert. Instead, PRISM decided to turn it into a charity concert and to include more performances from various artistes across both the Secondary and Senior sections of SJI. Since December 2016, the PRISM concert committee, including the PRISM members from the SJI String Ensemble, worked intensively to source for an appropriate venue, secure the different performing artistes, formulate the marketing strategy as well as to logistically manage and optimise manpower and financial resources. The committee harnessed the many talents within SJI in planning and producing the concert, including the design of the publicity posters and tickets.

<img src="![](/images/DSC00479.png)"  
style="width:60%">

The concert turned out to be an evening of musical treats, with performances by Beautiful Mind Music Academy students with special abilities as well as SJI’s award winning guitar ensemble, the string ensemble and our various bands. Heartstrings concluded with three songs by the award-winning 13-year old soprano soloist, Ms Lauren Yeo, who has sung in over 100 events worldwide. She is the first prize winner in the inaugural SLO-ASEAN Vocal Competition 2016 (junior category) organized by Singapore Lyric Opera for contestants all over South-East Asia.

<img src="![](/images/DSC00663.png)"  
style="width:60%">

The proceeds from the concert went to the two charity organisations—Riding for the Disabled Association and Beautiful Mind Charity. As a result of months of hard work and the support from many within the SJI community, the concert was a resounding success, as all the 300 tickets were sold out prior to the concert. The support of the audience, staff and students from SJI including our Principal, Father Danker, as well as the huge effort made by the amazing Prism concert committee, contributed to the success of Heartstring 2017.

#### May: A Night of Worship

<img src="![](/images/A%20Nite%20of%20Worship.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

With the theme ‘Come Back to God’, the inaugural Night of Worship was held on 26 May at LT3. Organised by a group of JC1 Catholics, the event aimed to offer Josephians and teachers a time to reflect on and give thanks for the term that has drawn to a close. The night began with worship songs and continued with a sharing from Fr Danker on letting go of the ‘baggages’ in our lives and placing our trust in God. This was followed by Eucharistic Adoration and a prayer service, where each of us could place our prayers before God in the form of a lit candle. While the Night of Worship followed Catholic traditions, it was heartening to see Josephians of various religious expressions come together for the event.

#### May:&nbsp;SJI Welcomes its 5th Student Council

By Shane Keiser (TG117)  
  

SJI’s Senior section conducted its 5th Student Council Investiture, “Mutatione Temporum - Changing of Seasons” on 26 May, in the style of a paraliturgy. It was a momentous occasion where the preceding council passed down their roles to the 25 new councillors - the largest Council SJI has ever had - for them to humbly accept a position of leadership and servitude to the Josephian community. The theme of the Investiture was the changing seasons; this embodied the idea of the passage of time in the life of thee Council--it is a cycle that has ups and downs, but ultimately ends in the passing on of leadership. The symbolism of the candles, being lit for the 4th Student Council and subsequently the 5th, symbolises the passing of passion from the old to the new council.

#### May: ArtScience 2017 - The Future of Water

By Isaac Chan Jing Xuan (MN302)  

The ArtScience exhibition on 26 May was the epilogue of a fruitful 4-month journey for the Secondary 3 IP students who had opted for the ArtScience module. Following this year’s theme of “The Future of Water”, we put on our thinking caps and invent or innovate a product involving the use of water that would assist in the betterment of the world and society at large. A single idea by a group member in the early stages of the ArtScience journey was then transformed into an advanced concept of a feasible idea through much brainstorming, meticulous research and the constructive feedback of our classmates and the teachers during the weekly ArtScience lessons. Our hard work culminated to a group presentation to two teacher-judges about the idea conceptualisation, translation and its benefits to society. The exhibition was held the following day.

<img src="![](/images/The%20Edible%20Soup%20Bubble.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

During this exhibition, we had the opportunity to showcase our ideas and prototypes to parents, teachers and fellow Josephians at the many booths set up in the school library. A total of about 40 exhibition booths immediately transformed the library into a vibrant learning hub. We took turns within our group members to share with the visitors our ideas and prototypes. Some of the ideas included Edible Soup Bubble where water can be used to make soup bubbles that are edible and at the same time, reduce food packaging. Another interesting idea was a salt-water powered transport boat utilising the salt in the seas and reservoirs to transport materials from place to place, encouraging less reliance on cargo planes, which require the use of fossil fuels.

<img src="![](/images/Hydroboden.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The exhibition was an absolutely fulfilling end to the enjoyable ArtScience journey for every student and teacher who had the opportunity to imagine and innovate. In the spirit of ArtScience, all ideas are feasible. Think bluesky because the sky is the limit.

Conducting radio calisthenics

  

On 26 May 2017, the Guitar Ensemble served at Kreta Ayer Senior Activity Centre, to share the spirit of giving and love, and to spread joy to the less fortunate and elderly. We were delighted to see that the elderly warmly welcomed us with open arms. However, language barriers soon kicked in after we started the activities, as most of the elderly spoke only Mandarin or Cantonese. As we started radio calisthenics, we not only had a lot of fun, but managed to cheer them up. The boys also sang with the elderly, and helped the elderly to design their own fridge magnets.

Though everyone was busy helping the elderly design the magnet, or to take photos of them; everyone were really enjoying the experience. The boys were heartened to know that they had spread the warmth and joy to these elderly, which was the takeaway from this whole experience. The Guitar Ensemble will continue to meet up with the elderly in Term 3.

#### May: A Growth Mindset for SJI Teachers

By Mr Joseph Edison Junior

Growth Mindset was embarked on as a personal hobby to learn more about taking on challenges and facing roadblocks and how to manage expectations. It then led to trying to expand it and entice more teachers to learn from the good work written by Carol Dweck with the 2016 Sec 1s and the teachers.

  

This year, we were excited to have a trainer who willingly ran a two-day pro-bono workshop to train the teachers about Growth Mindset in the classroom and growing oneself. Our first session was held in April and the second one in late May to allow incubation of ideas and practicing what we learnt from session 1 and sharing at session 2 what was achieved.

  

The SJI teachers learnt a great deal through gameplay, sharing, anecdotes, role play and even group discussions. Mrs Tan Nga Hoon of Gifted Branch at MOE gave us good insights and examples as a trainer and for her age, she was the epitome of what Growth Mindset looks like.

  

While this is still a work in progress for us at SJI, every endeavour requires small steps together. SJI was fortunate to have one of our own to share and help us learn more about Growth Mindset.

From 19 to 21 May, Josephians were offered an opportunity at the Secondary 3 Catholic Retreat to explore the masks they wear that often get in the way of who they really are. It began with the assumption that everyone tries to hide behind a mask at some point—even people who seemed confident and self-assured. Accompanied by eight Franciscan Friars, the boys examined their own false masks and discovered ways to reveal their true self.

April: Understanding the English Curriculum as Lived: Experiential Learning at Orchard Road
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By Mr Karthickeyen s/o Govindaraj  
  

‘_**Tell me and I forget, teach me and I remember, involve me and I learn.**_’ – Benjamin Franklin

  

Franklin’s words, as mentioned above, remind us how knowledge is created through the transformation of experience – a belief educators at SJI subscribe to. Thus, in the spirit of understanding the IB Diploma (IBDP) English curriculum as lived, some JC1 students made their way to Orchard Road in late April to identify and assess guerrilla advertisements with the following questions in mind:  

1.  How do commercial advertisements in Singapore interpret persuasion?  
    
2.  How is persuasion visually presented to the masses, with an emphasis on language use and its relationship with images.  
    

  

The learning journey took place every Friday, across three weeks, to suit each class’s varied schedules. In wanting to be part of the hustle and bustle characterizing Singapore’s popular shopping boulevard, students made their way to Orchard road at sunset with ION Shopping Centre as the starting point of their journey. Seated on the steps in front of ION, students began to familiarize themselves with a guide sheet spelling out five guerrilla marketing techniques popular amongst 21st century advertisers. Guerrilla marketing, as an advertisement strategy concept, was new to students at the time when the guide sheets were distributed to them. Nonetheless, the purpose in getting students to engage with unknown information lay in the pedagogical belief that the unknown must be negotiated with the known. As students were already familiar with the principles of persuasion via visual and multi-modal advertisements in class, they now had to apply what they had learnt - under time constraints - to comprehend the features of a text-type similar to many advertisements, albeit unique in its approach with regard to persuasion. As predicted, students either independently or with peer support understood the key features of guerrilla marketing and spent an hour, amidst laughter and chatter, identifying and assessing guerrilla advertisements.

![Pic 2.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2017/Pic%202.jpg)  

At the end of the “advertisement-hunt”, students made their way back to ION where they had to complete a worksheet that helped them reflect about what they had seen and learnt, and to write a critical commentary about a guerrilla advertisement that caught their attention.

  

About the experiential learning session at Orchard Road, Kevan Toh shared, ‘This trip made me more observant of my surroundings and more critical about how firms portray their branding’. Johanna Lim Ziyun echoed similar sentiments, ‘I felt the trip was beneficial and engaging as we got the opportunity to learn about advertisements in an innovative way, allowing me to understand advertisements better’.

![Pic 3.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2017/Pic%203.jpg)  

The learning journey brought language and culture together, allowing students to appreciate how the classroom is not confined within a school building and that, the value of learning does not solely lie in the appreciation of the hypothesis but in every sense of the word, the lived experience too.

The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2017 taught us how to be more than just an ensemble, it’s akin to being part of a family. We played together, trained together, loving every second of it. Despite our anxieties, we were still able to put our trust in one another and play as one united ensemble. This cumulated to the ensemble being awarded the Certificate of Distinction in April 2017. We thank the school leaders, our instructors, our teachers, parents and all those who have supported us in one way or another.

April: Minister&nbsp;Tan Chuan-Jin Dialogues with IBDP Students
----------------------------------------------------------

By Ms Cherie Chua

SJI had the honour of having Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, Minister for Social and Family Development, at SJI for a dialogue with our Junior College 2 students on 17 April. Through this formal dialogue, students were able to understand some of the societal issues that Singapore faces. Minister Tan also discussed some issues like the Values-In-Action programme that schools do and how these impact on the society. He is very passionate about helping the community together and feel strongly that as long as everyone work together to help the community, no matter how big or how small the action is, an impact will be felt eventually.

  

This discussion provoked the minds of many of our students and both parties had a meaningful time talking about issues that will affect them as students but may also have great impact as a society. At the same time, Minister Tan also gave our students some insights about the life of a Singapore politician and how he copes with his work and family to ensure that there is work life balance. The students had a gratifying session with Minister Tan and gained many insights from the conversation.

April: SJI Scouts Join in St Margaret's Girl Guides Campfire
------------------------------------------------------------

By Gabriel Tan (FN301)  
![SMSS CF-Our SJI Scouts posing at the end of the Campfire.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2017/SMSS%20CF-Our%20SJI%20Scouts%20posing%20at%20the%20end%20of%20the%20Campfire.jpg)  

On 8 April, a handful of SJI scouts visited St Margaret’s Secondary School to attend their annual Girl Guide’s Campfire, which was themed “Alice in Wonderland”. The plot was that the modern world and its people were found to be similar to the characters in Alice in Wonderland. For example, Alice was an office worker who was constantly oppressed and abused by her dictator-like boss. The boss was also shown to be similar to the notorious and tyrannical Red Queen. This showed us how we need to stand up for our beliefs as well as make workplaces more fun and conducive.

  

SJI’s Secondary 4 scouts also performed a dance to the song “Stole the Show” by Kygo. Their synchronised and creative dancing won thunderous applause by the guides and scouts who attended the campfire. The event also featured many fun games such as Scavenger Hunt, Musical Chairs and Don’t Forget the Lyrics. The Josephians put in their utmost efforts and clinched an overall first place for games.

![SMSS CF-Our Sec 4 Scouts performing their dance.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2017/SMSS%20CF-Our%20Sec%204%20Scouts%20performing%20their%20dance.jpg)  

The campfire was very well-run, featuring creativity, innovation as well as a smooth flow of activities in conjunction with the storyline. We went back home with a great sense of achievement, friendships with other scouts and guides and the knowledge on how to run our own campfires in future.

April: Lenten Season - A Season of Fasting, Reconciliation and Alms-giving
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Josephians started off their Lenten journey this year with the Sacrament of Reconciliation. This was to help Josephians experience God's love and forgiveness for us through understanding the Lord's passion, death and resurrection.

  

On Maundy Thursday, the SJI family gathered to remember and journey with the Lord during His Passion, Death and Resurrection. The solemn remembrance started with the washing of the feet, the re-enactment of the act of love by Jesus for His Twelve disciples on the night of The Last Supper.

  

The boys started their Easter Triduum with Maundy Thursday Mass and journeyed together with their respective Catholic CCAs on their visitation to the various churches in Singapore. They returned for the night, and continued their Lenten vigil with an early hour Stations of the Cross, which was followed by Good Friday Service. A blessed tiredness that is not only fulfilling but a spirit-filled Lenten Vigil for them.

  

The Catholic parents also embarked on a Lenten Project during this season of giving with “Eating soup for the Poor” – where they cooked and sold various wholesome soups for the Josephians, to prepare them for their Lenten sacrifices over two Fridays. The sale of soup was to raise funds for the needy.

April: SJI's PRISM Raises Funds and Adopts "Louis" from the Riding For The Disabled Association of Singapore
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Funded by Citi Foundation and organised by YMCA, Citi-YMCA Youth For Causes (YFC) aims to promote social entrepreneurship among youths and encourage youths to play an active role in making a positive impact on society. Across Singapore every year, 100 teams of four members engage on this meaningful journey to support a voluntary welfare organisation (VWO) of their choice with a seed fund of $1,600. In 2016, nine teams from SJI represented PRISM, a social entrepreneurship club in SJI’s senior section, successfully raising close to $50,000 for their chosen VWOs.

  
![RDA2-IMG_9230.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2017/RDA2-IMG_9230.JPG)

From left to right: Joelle Tan Hwee Inn, Peng Lihong, Li Zijian and Mark Wee Yi Ren

  

In particular, Team IGNITE from PRISM managed to use the $1,600 seed fund to raise over $12,000 for their chosen VWO, Riding For The Disabled Association of Singapore (RDA). Over a six-month period, Team IGNITE organised a whole host of activities such as street sales, where Team IGNITE designed and sold a range of merchandise, successfully raising funds and awareness for RDA. The efforts of Team IGNITE were not in vain and they eventually succeeded at accomplishing the seemingly inconceivable goal of raising $12,000 to sponsor a horse for one year. Team IGNITE consequently proudly adopted Louis, an affectionate yet athletic horse, who will provide free horse riding therapy for the disabled. They paid him a visit on 11 April 2017 at RDA Centre and the bond was special. When asked to sum up the YFC experience, Team IGNITE agreed that although the journey was challenging, it was a very enriching and fulfilling one.

April: Marching On at the 165th Anniversary Parade
--------------------------------------------------

This year's Anniversary Parade on 7 April is historic, as it marks the 165th anniversary of SJI's founding as a school as well as our return to home to Malcolm Road campus after three years of redevelopment works. We were privileged to have our Guest of Honour - alumnus BG Paul Chew (Class of 1988), Director of Military Security (MINDEF) to grace this parade.

  

The 165th Anniversary Parade honours our Uniformed Groups (UGs), whose members have contributed to the ongoing development of SJI. Their efforts were built on the earlier work of Josephians. This is how we have built SJI over the years: each batch of Josephians adding to the SJI story; every Josephian making a contribution to help SJI develop further and better.

  

At this parade, we also witnessed the Change in Command from the seniors to their juniors. This marks the passing on of command and stewardship. Just as the seniors have led each UG well by building on the strong foundations, the new commanders are called to add on to what has been achieved and to take their UGs even further. They now have the task of continuing the good work each UG has accomplished this past year as evidenced by the many awards of excellence they have all garnered at the national level. These new commanders have the task ahead to nurture their juniors and their units to strive for greater heights. It is how Josephians have always made a difference and helped the school move forward and upward.

  

Many gathered in SJI for this year's Anniversary Parade at Malcolm Road. Our coming together testifies to the strong Josephian Spirit we share. As our senior members step down from leadership and our juniors step up to command, let us support them in the Josephian Spirit that binds us together but that also invites us to keep striving to change for the better as we look ahead with hope to the next 165 years of Josephian education.

April: SJI Celebrates 165th Founder's Day
-----------------------------------------

By Shriharan S/O Ganesan (FN301)

This year marks SJI's 165th anniversary, a milestone to celebrate 165 years of the De La Salle Brothers’ presence, progress and achievements in Singapore.

  

On 7 April, the Church and the Lasallian family worldwide remembers the death anniversary of our Founder, St. John Baptist de La Salle. The day began with a mass celebrated by Fr Adrian Danker, and Friar Michael D’Cruz gave his homily and invited the students to reflect on their lives in SJI. For the secondary and JC1s, a new chapter of their lives had unfolded when they joined SJI this year, while the secondary 4s and JC2s reflected on their SJI journey that they have endured with their peers, teachers, and family.

  

The celebrations continued with the Founder’s Day ceremony. The former Scout Leader of the Scout Troop, Mr James Tseng Yan Li (also known as Pelandok) was our Guest of Honour. Students who had clinched stellar results in their academics and sports through their diligence, conscientiousness and enthusiasm in the past year were presented with awards. It was undeniably an honourable moment for these students and their parents who were present to contemplate awards being bestowed upon their child. Peers of these students cheered their award-winning schoolmates as their made their way up on stage to collect their well deserved prizes.

April: SJI Commemorates International Friendship Day
----------------------------------------------------

SJI commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on 3 April. The theme for IFD this year is ASEAN 50. This day brought Josephians, staff and parents together as they learnt about the importance of good relations with our neighbours and beyond, and how these relations cannot be taken for granted. During assembly, our International Josephians put up a skit to showcase the importance of how to relate well with people from different cultures, both within Singapore and in the world. The parents also set up stalls featuring food from ASEAN and different parts of the world.

April: PRISM Wins Finals of Youth Innovation Challenge 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------

![Team Insight-Peng Lihong, Na Byung Hee, Natasha Wong and Cho Mei En.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2017/Team%20Insight-Peng%20Lihong,%20Na%20Byung%20Hee,%20Natasha%20Wong%20and%20Cho%20Mei%20En.jpg)

Team Insight, comprising four PRISM members from JC2—Peng Lihong, Na Byung Hee, Natasha Wong and Cho Mei En (from left - right in the photo insert)—has succeeded in entering the final round of the 2017 Youth Innovation Competition organized by the Singapore Management University (SMU). The team competed against the other top schools in Singapore on 1 April 2017 and they clinched the most comprehensive business plan award, winning for themselves $1,500 cash and a trophy.

  

The competition serves as a platform for entrepreneurs of tomorrow to showcase their ideas, business plans and entrepreneurial talents and attract potential seed funding to further their social enterprise ideas. The team is passionate about the ageing population problem in Asia including Singapore. They worked throughout the December holidays and, eventually, came up with a multifunctional and wearable smart device that provides navigation assistance, facial recognition, emergency alerts and general age support functions including vocalizing small‐worded text to the elderly. The business pitch originated from the pressing concern of an impending ‘Silver Tsunami’ in Singapore, which will strain the country’s financial resources as healthcare costs rise exponentially with rapidly deteriorating mobility, hearing, vision and memory among the elderly.

  

The Team hopes that their product will one day become commercially viable and help the elderly remain more mobile and independent as they age. They believe this will help arrest many of the age‐related ailments like dementia with a less sedentary lifestyle. As the team continues to prepare for the final round of the competition, they agree that the business fundamentals that they have learnt and the experience gained are invaluable. This is best summarized by one of the members of team, who said, 'We have grown so much along the way, and regardless of the result, we will always cherish the experience we have gained, continue passing on the flame of our faith in our community, and most importantly keep working hard for the sake of a better world.'

March: SJI Guitar Ensemble Learns From Japanese Master Conductors
-----------------------------------------------------------------

By Law Bing Feng, Keith (MN 401), Vice President, SJI Guitar Ensemble (2016-2017)  
![Niibori MasterClass.jpeg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2017/Niibori%20MasterClass.jpeg)  

On 14 March 2017, two distinguished guitar instructors from the International Niibori Music Academy based in Kyoto, Japan, Mr Kazuyuki Terada (Chief Conductor) and Mr Yoshinori Takeuchi came to SJI to conduct a professional masterclass to help the SJI Guitar Ensemble prepare for the upcoming Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation.

  

Working on our two performance pieces, Summer's Wind and Big Band Medley (arranged by Mr Jiro Hasabe and Mr Micheal Gaspar respectively), the two master conductors helped to take the pieces to a whole new level. From adding new layers of expression to fine-tuning our playing techniques wherever possible, the two masterclass instructors' expertise clearly spoke for itself.

  

Minor details such as our string attack position to slight tempo inconsistencies were all picked up and swiftly rectified by the conductors, with our music quality showing an obvious and immediate improvement under their guidance. Under their unique and interesting style of guidance, the SJI guitar ensemble indeed learnt a lot during the 2-hour experience and improved our techniques tremendously in ways that we did not expect. The two instructors undoubtedly provided a large stepping stone towards our SYF performance.

“Growing with and through each other” was the theme for this year’s Day of Recollection on 11 March. It was aptly chosen by the Catholic student leadership team from the various Catholic CCAs. One of the objectives of this day was to encounter God by getting to know one other well, from the Sec 1s to the Sec 4s. It is part of the faith building process where every Josephian tries to support each other in their growing journey. One of the highlights of the day was the newly minted Sec 1s witnessing the investiture of their upper secondary leaders with the pinning of the badge by their respective CCA teacher‐in‐charge. The camp was followed by a consecration to our Mother for the year. It ended with the Eucharist celebration.

March: Mass Swim
----------------

By Nge Chi-E (MN302)

The 2017 mass swim was held on 8 and 9 March at the Yio Chu Kang Swimming Complex. The blaring sound from the air horn indicated the start of the event, and students started swimming towards the other end of the pool. Some glided through the water with swift strokes, competing against each other or aiming for their personal gold. Others swam alongside each other at their own pace, bonding with each other and sharing a good laugh. Josephians cladded in uniform and their respective Fraternity shirts sat at the spectator stand to cheer for their classmates.

March: The SJI Spirit Rained at 109th Annual Sports Meet
--------------------------------------------------------

By Caleb Chan Jing‐Rei (FN301)

The 109th SJI Annual Sports Meet on 3 March saw Josephians from the fraternities of Fintan, Lawrence, Marcian, and Michael come together to cheer for their houses and the runners of each race. Coloured flags waved in the air and loud choruses of cheers, stomps and singing could be heard from students with fraternity‐coloured painted faces throughout the Bishan stadium.

  

From the 50m dash to the 4x100m relay, each event had Josephians close to the edge of their seats watching the races in anticipation. Students from SJI International and St. Patrick’s and friends from Rainbow Centre also dropped by our Sports Meet for a friendly relay. Although the rain came down on our parade that day, the downpour did not dampen our spirits; Josephians remain united, supporting the runners right till the end.

It was a nail-biting and intense match on 28 Feb as both our SJI B &amp; C Division shuttlers met their competition from Ang Mo Kio Secondary School and ACS Barker respectively.

  

The cheers that supported the players almost brought the house down as both teams battle it out on adjacent courts. The true Josephian fighting spirit was witnessed at every single turn of the game. With determination and perseverance, our C Division players beat ACS Barker boys with a score of 3-2, clinching the coveted 3rd place in the South Zone competition.

  

"SJI! SJI!" – was the glorious cheer that began our game. For every point scored, cheers echoed across the hall from the SJI boys. Knocked out from Top 4 position in the previous year, the Josephians were eager to win back the title. Initially losing to Ang Mo Kio Secondary School 2 - 0, the determined boys struck back with a vengeance to win 3-2, after an intense match. With their heads held high, our shuttlers left the court gloriously with a 3rd position placing in the South zone games, proud that they had exceeded all expectations.

February: What It Means To Be A Josephian
-----------------------------------------

SJIOBA organized a talk on 23 February for the freshly enrolled Secondary One boys to meet the alumni who shared their thoughts on “What It M eans To Be A Josephian”. The interactive session was to help the students in their formative years to become exemplary Josephians and also to appreciate the rich heritage of SJI.

![IMG-20170224-WA0084.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2017/IMG-20170224-WA0084.jpg)  

Simon Seow (Class of 2000) who shared his Josephian experiences said, "Speaking to the Secondary 1s brought back a lot of memories for me. It was like speaking to my younger self. I see their character peeking through their shy or boisterous exteriors. The students were interested to know about what extra-curricular activities to join. I brought my old band gloves, photos, and memorabilia to show the fun we had then."

February: SJI Commemorates Total Defence Day
--------------------------------------------

SJI was honoured to have alumnus LTC Alvin Tjioe (Class of 1997) commemorate Total Defence Day with the Josephian family on 13 February this year. With the threat of a light drizzle, the school community felt his humility even with his commanding voice, as he shared his love for the country. SJI has played a special part in shaping him to become who he is today, through his time in NCC (Land) and the Peer Support Programme. A Lieutenant Colonel with a heart for his soldiers, he shared what it takes to be a good citizen and a Josephian, to have resilience, and to be grateful for the racial harmony that exists in Singapore. Josephians also observed a minute of silence in remembrance of the 16 Brothers who lost their lives for the sake of God in the Manila Massacre in 1945. This was followed by the sound of the solemn bugle to signify that we should not take our defence for granted.

February: SJI Celebrates Home Coming to Malcolm Road
----------------------------------------------------

The highlight of our celebrations was the SJI Inaugural and Homecoming party on 10 February, where SJI had its first ever picnic cum night party for students and staff. Josephians danced and cheered against an array of glowing house colours on the walls where our St John Baptist de La Salle statue now stands.

  

Maretta Simon (JC106) shared, “Homecoming has never been as great – the live band, the atmosphere, and of course, the people were beyond amazing. It was a stellar night of performances which will be tattooed in the memories of every Josephian. Everyone was caught in the moment of pure joy; Josephians sang in unison to their hearts’ content, and this sight was truly heartwarming. Not only did we see the physical bond between fellow Josephians, but the sense of being welcomed was heartfelt too. We have indeed come home.”

February: SJI's Pelandok Scouts Holds Joint Event with St Margaret's Girl Guides
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By Sanskar Gupta (FN401)  

On 3 and 4 February, the St. Joseph’s Pelandok Scouts Troop held a combined activity with the Girl Guides from St. Margaret’s Secondary School. As scouts, one of our laws and a core objective is to make friends, as well as establish and maintain harmonious relations, which was our main objective of this event.

  

We kicked off the first day with icebreakers at St. Margaret’s Secondary School, followed by a host of interactive and teambuilding games. As the day came to an end, the groups were then given time to prepare for their items for the gangshow, which would be held on the next day.

  

The groups started off the second day with pioneering, the main activity of the day. This was an opportunity for the participants to build the structure they had planned for, as well as strengthen relationships within and between the groups. This was followed by a few games for the guides and scouts to enjoy before the gangshow. At the end of the combined event, the groups were given time to present their items.

February:&nbsp;Terra Nova: Exploring the New Lands of SJI
----------------------------------------------------

By Audrey Tung (JC106)  
  

On 3 February, 275 Junior College One (JC1) students came together for the very first time and were tasked to explore their new territories on S‐J‐Island. It was not long before new friendships were forged and laughter shared amongst them as they began their exploration as one family.

  

Orientation started off on a high note with the Josephian Challenge, where the new Josephians explored their new home and learned what is expected of them in the SJI family. A vital programme of the orientation was the heritage trail: the JC1s returned to the original SJI campus situated at Bras Basah Road (now known as the Singapore Art Museum). They learned about the vision and mission of De La Salle and his Brothers. At the same time, it reminded them of their responsibility to pass on the passion of De La Salle.

  

The camaraderie amongst the JC1s was further strengthened as they bonded over mass games and amazing race. They had to complete various stations all over Singapore, ranging from Sentosa to Gardens by the Bay and the National Stadium. Decoding clues and maneuvering around allowed them to form priceless memories and allowed each other’s strengths to be showcased.

  

Not only did the JC1s spend quality time with their tutor groups, they also bonded with their respective houses – Fintan, Lawrance, Marcian and Michael through house games. From playing capture the flag to a tug of war, the house spirit was at its highest.

  

The orientation ended with a blast at the Campfire. As the campfire was lit, the green flames are symbolic of the burning SJI spirit ignited in the hearts of the JC1s through the orientation. As they sang St. Joseph's Call with gusto, a homely feeling warmed everyone's hearts.

  

Welcome to the SJI family, JC 1s! Ora et Labora!

February: SJI Celebrates Lunar New Year with Gifts of Gratitude
---------------------------------------------------------------

SJI celebrated Chinese New Year by thanking the construction workers who redeveloped our campus and our cleaners who daily maintain it. Our staff and students prepared 65 hand-made hampers from each class or department on 26 January, as a gift to this community of workers who contributed tirelessly behind the scene to get the campus ready for the new school year. What better way to celebrate the Year of the Rooster than to give to others as a school, and to give abundantly!

  

The festive celebrations continued on 3 February, as staff and students came together for a mega toss of "_lo-hei_" in school, to mark the 7th day of the lunar new year which is also known as "人日" (ren-ri; which means everybody's birthday). The&nbsp;_lo-hei_&nbsp;were sponsored by the&nbsp;[SJI Parent Support Group (SJI PSG)](https://www.sji.edu.sg/parents/about-parent-support-group).

January: Growing in Fraternity Through Camp TABA
------------------------------------------------

By Amadeus Lam Tze Min (FN301) and Dhivesh (LE301)  

Camp TABA (Together‐And‐By‐Association) is one of the most memorable experiences of every upper secondary student. At Secondary 3, besides the change from shorts to long pants, it also marks the boys’ transition from adolescents to young men of integrity. Camp TABA was organised for the Secondary 3 cohort to bond with their new classmates and form tutors.

  

This year, the camp was held at St Patrick’s School and the boys walked with their classmates from SJI to the campsite with ice‐breakers along the way. This truly encouraged new members of the class to bond and persevere throughout the walk.

  

During the camp, team bonding games and class reflections brought the new classmates together and by association. Through Camp TABA, we learnt the values of teamwork, listening and togetherness. Through activities like the snake game, we learnt that we need each other to propel us forward to success, for without that helping hand, we would plunge. Through the Hurl the Ball activity, we understood the need to listen to each other so we can learn our weaknesses and strengths and use them to work towards success. Finally, through the Build The LASALLIAN poster activity, we learnt that each and every one of us play a crucial part in SJI and when we are united, we can work together to accomplish more.

  

Camp TABA gave meaning to our classes and made us understand the saying “all for one and one for all”, and what it means to be united as a class, a fraternity, a level and as a school.

January: Josephians Achieve Stellar Performance at 2016 GCE 'O' Level Examinations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SJI’s Class of 2016 has performed very well in the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations. The school achieved 100% passes, with 100% receiving at least 5 GCE ‘O’ Level passes. All the boys will advance to junior colleges and polytechnics for their post-secondary education, with 98% of the boys qualifying for junior college.

  

The Class of 2016 is the first batch of boys to take the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations since the dual track programme started in SJI in 2013. 48% (124 out of 260 boys) scored 6A’s or more, and 74% (192/260) of the boys achieved scores of less than 10 points.

  

SJI is extremely proud of the boys’ achievements and the school wishes them well in their next phase of post-secondary education.

  

Fr Adrian Danker says, “I am so very happy for our Class of 2016. They have achieved these very good results by living our school values fully and joyfully. They have lived with faith in themselves and in God to do well and in God’s guidance. They have grown up together as a community by supporting each other. They have learnt that the value of their SJI education is when they uplift others. Most of all I am delighted because this year’s results continue the school's value-adding efforts over the years. Last year we added value to the Class of 2015; this year, we have added even more value to our students.”

  

Ms Surjeet Kaur who teaches History said that this year’s results were the sweetest and best for her in her 23 years of teaching in SJI. Like many teachers, she attributed this to the students’ perseverance to stay the course to the end, never giving up, even as they face their own challenges and struggles.

January: SJI Students Excel at 2016 International Baccalaureate Diploma Examinations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SJI’s Class of 2016 International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) students have performed well in the November 2016 examinations. All 80 students from our third IBDP cohort passed the examinations, and achieved an average score of 41.5 out of 45 points. This is higher than the average score of 40.7 attained by our Class of 2015, and the 2016 national average of 38.27 and the global average of 29.21.

  

The Class of 2016 also produced SJI’s first perfect scorer since the IBDP started in 2013. 10 students had a near perfect score of 44 points and 84% (67 out of 80) students attained at least 40 points out of 45.

  

The Class of 2016 has surpassed the results set by their predecessors, evident of a trend that the SJI IBDP relates well with our students who enjoyed high academic expectations from the programme. They found joy in learning by being risk-takers who pursue their interests and passion, instead of being rote-learners.

  

Fr (Dr) Adrian Danker, SJ, Principal, says “We are very proud of our third batch of IBDP students who have graduated with stunning results. More importantly, we are glad to know that our students have enjoyed learning from the two-year IBDP. We are confident that they are well prepared for their next phase of education beyond SJI. But what I am particularly proud of our school's achievement is that our students achieved this by having a healthy and happy balance between studies and play, between learning deeply and serving the community generously, between acquiring skills to do well in the world and letting our Lasallian values and ethos form them into men and women who now want to go out and make a difference in our world. To see this alive in our students is for me the enduring gift they have received from an SJI education that I know they will share with many.”

  

The Head of SJI’s Senior section, Mr Nick Moughtin, is very pleased with the results and is proud of the students. He said, “We encouraged them to "aim high and get involved"; they seized the opportunities to be responsible for their own learning, pursuing and developing their interests and passions beyond the academics.”

  

As a Catholic and Lasallian school, SJI is committed to developing every student’s character and to helping them realize their academic potential, so that they become men and women whose education empowers them to make a positive difference in the world. The IBDP results of the 2016 cohort are an affirmation of the quality of the balanced and holistic education offered at SJI.
