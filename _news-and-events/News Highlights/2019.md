#### November: Josephians Participate in YDSP Science &amp; Technology Camp

Three SJI students -&nbsp;**Kieran Foo**&nbsp;(LE303),&nbsp;**Darren Lim**&nbsp;(FN301) and&nbsp;**David Ho**&nbsp;(MN401) - were nominated by their Science teachers to attend the Youth Defence Science Program (YDSP) Science and Technology Camp, organised by the Defence Science Technology Agency (DSTA) from 25 to 29 November 2019.

  

Participants at the camp came from schools from all over Singapore. During the entirety of the non-residential course, the Josephians learnt to work with the “micro: bit” software and how it powers various electrical components using a “MicroBit” circuit chip. The trio was grouped with two other boys from NUS High. They became fast friends and worked well together. Their goal was to build and programme a remotely-operated robot and control it to collect diving rings scattered randomly in a pool. The camp culminated in a competition where each team is to pit their robot against others.

  

The students were free to experiment and explore and were not tied to a specific design or procedure. This meant that they had to overcome many obstacles and problems such as the batteries overheating hence producing smoke and then falling into the bottom of the pool. Despite the many challenges, they continued to work hard to make their robot as smooth and functional as possible.

  

In the end, their determination and perseverance paid off as their robot worked wonders and they emerged Champions.

  

For Kieran Foo, this was "an insightful out-of-the-classroom experience" as they could try their hands at prototyping and designing their own robot!

#### November: Music CCA Student Leaders Participate in MOE Combined Music Leadership Camp 2019

<img src="![](/images/Combined%20Choir%20at%20the%20MOE%20Leadership%20Camp%20Showcase.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

216 Music CCA student leaders from 115 schools participated in the MOE Combined Music Leadership Camp 2019 held at the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory, National University of Singapore (NUS) from 13 - 16 November. Conducted by music trainers - Dr Leonard Tan, Mr Jonathan Velasco, Mr Balraj Gopal, Mr Dedric Wong, the camp was to empower the participants in their role as music student leaders by providing art-form-specific leadership training and engage participants in collective dialogue and music-making. Assis Kevin Franklin Benedict (MN202) shares his reflections from the camp:

  

"Entering a sea of unknown faces but leaving with a hundred connected souls through music and shared experience has made me determined to look forward to a positive change in my Music CCA. The first day at the Stephen Riady Centre at NUS was a day of introduction. I made friends and learnt who our conductor and teachers in charge were. One common thing was that everyone was extremely positive and passionate about music. It was infectious and everyone slowly adopted a similar attitude. I loved that. Over the course of the three days, I learnt warm-up styles, the order of how to approach new songs as a choir and how to conduct. Apart from that, we learnt general leadership skills and how to approach a specific situation that may arise in our course as leaders. Each one of us was representing our schools as leaders thus we all had different skills to share with each other. Some were good at conducting while some were good at singing loudly and projecting their voice. Each one of us had a different personality to discover.

  

An instant connection was palpable among the tenor section in which I sang and we become better friends. Overcoming the difficult parts together and enjoying each others' company was a lunchtime ritual. Apart from that, we held group discussions about leadership duties. These group discussions enabled us to meet and work with different people from various music CCAs. The duties I performed at the camp taught me the value of servant leadership and it was easy for me to identify with being a Josephian. The briefings and practice sessions culminated in the final showcase on the fourth day.

  

Selected to be an emcee and a soloist from among the participants, I am pleased to have done SJI proud with my performance on stage and grateful to have worked with wonderful people. I am also thankful for the opportunity given to me and I hope to share what I have learnt with my CCA members in SJI."

#### October: Navigating through Economic Uncertainty

Our Economics Department organised its 3rd Economics Symposium on 29 October, themed “Navigating through Economic Uncertainty”. As the global economic environment becomes more complex and challenging, the focus was on three main topics - Trade war, income inequality &amp; unemployment and Technology Disruption and Creation. The symposium brought together a panel of six distinguished speakers:

  

1.  Dr Prakash Kannan, Chief Economist &amp; Head, Total Portfolio Management, GIC;
2.  Mr Prashant Bhayani, Chief Investment Officer, Asia, BNP Paribas Wealth Management;
3.  Mr John Doyle, Chief Investment Officer (Multi-Asset), UOB Asset Management;
4.  Mr Song Seng Wun, Economist (Director), CIMB Private Banking;
5.  Professor David Lee Kuo Chuen, School of Business, Finance Programme, Singapore University of Social Sciences and Vice President of The Economic Society of Singapore; and
6.  Ms Magdalene Loh, Senior Vice President and Head of Innovation, Prudential.

<img src="![](/images/symposium%203.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

The symposium began with a welcome address by SJI's principal Fr Adrian Danker, followed by the keynote address by Mr Prashant Bhayani and three discussion forums. Our Economics students, as well as participants from nine schools including Victoria Junior College, SOTA, Hwa Chong International, Millennia Institute, and Dulwich College, received invaluable insights and expert economic knowledge from the panel speakers. The ensuing Q&amp;A session was lively and energetic as students deliberated on the issues and key economic trends addressed and raised by the different speakers. The symposium was a platform for the students to think critically about major economic issues such as the counter-intuitive trends of both rising income inequality and increasing globalisation, as well as how technology can be a double-edged sword to lift individuals out of poverty but also displace workers.

<img src="![](/images/symposium%204.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

The symposium provided an opportunity for the students to hear and interact with renowned economists, bankers and innovators from the financial services industry and academics. It stimulated critical thinking of important and troubling economic trends, to fuel further thoughtful classroom discussions.

#### October: In Thanksgiving for 2019

At the Thanksgiving Assembly on 25 October, we were invited to recap the year in the form of a "report card" of all that we have accomplished and can be thankful for in 2019. For some, it was serving others well. For many, it was garnering achievements in academic or CCA/CAS competitions. For a few it may have been making it through challenging times because of mistakes and not so wonderful moments in life. However the school year was for us, everyone was invited to give thanks for the many lessons of life and faith that we learned.

  

At the Thanksgiving Assembly this year, two new sports awards were presented by two former iconic PE teachers of SJI - Mr Peter Martens and Mr Patrick Zehnder.

  

**• Peter Martens Trophy**  
Mr Peter Martens (Class of 1952) was a revered hockey coach at SJI where he also taught Mathematics, English and Literature. He is remembered for his mentorship, the inspiration he imparted to the players, his wit and his tireless love for the sport. This Trophy was established in 2018 by Old Boys, all hockey players, to honour their former coach. As a testament to his attributes and values, this Trophy is awarded annually to a Year 1-2 student-athlete who has excelled outstandingly well in his sport at the National level. The criteria for the award is the award of SSSC Colours Award (Distinction) for that year. The 2019 Peter Martens Trophy is awarded to&nbsp;**Russell Yom Zhenyi**&nbsp;(MN202) who has achieved Colours Award (Distinction) in Sailing.

  

**• Patrick Zehnder Trophy**  
Mr Patrick Zehnder (Class of 1954) was a dedicated and respected Track &amp; Field coach at SJI where he was Head of the Physical Education Department. He is remembered for his love for all sports, his passion for sportsmanship, his mentorship and his drive to keep the human body fit. This Trophy was established in 2018 by Old Boys, all athletes, to honour their former coach and teacher. As a testament to these attributes and values, this Trophy is to be given to the fittest Year 2 student, based on the NAPFA test, thereby encouraging the student to excel in his sport or in his pursuit of fitness. The 2019 Patrick Zehnder Trophy is awarded to&nbsp;**Kieran Andre Longue**&nbsp;(ML202) who clocked a timing of 8 mins 15 secs in 2.4km.

#### October: SJI Celebrates the Retirement of 3 Long-Service Staff  

[https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/48979731832/in/album-72157711549723083](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/48979731832/in/album-72157711549723083)

As the year draws slowly to a close, moments become memories. The staff gathered to remember why St John Baptist de La Salle started his schools at the staff paraliturgy on 18 October. At the same event, we also celebrated the retirement of 3 iconic staff who have dedicated decades of their lives to the service of the school:

  

*   **Mr Chew Sung Luan**, our Senior Laboratory Technician, is an iconic figure in SJI. He joined SJI on 8 Jun 1970 and has served SJI for 49 years. He has been the backbone of our school laboratory staff, from Bras Basah to Malcolm Road. Mr Chew is very skillful at making and repairing things, especially items in the laboratory. He also makes educational adult wood puzzles/steel puzzles.
  
*   **Ms Balkis Bee Abdul Karim**&nbsp;joined SJI on 28 Sep 1971 as a Clerical Assistant. Over the years she proved to be an industrious and devoted staff who rose through the ranks to her current position as Executive Secretary to the Principal. In her career spanning 48 years at SJI, she has served 7 Principals including 4 Lasalle Brothers Patrick Loh, Joseph Kiely, Kevin Byrne, Paul Rogers, Mr Lui Seng Cheong, Dr Koh Thiam Seng and Fr (Dr) Adrian Danker, SJ.
  
*   **Ms Angayarkanni Periasamy**&nbsp;joined SJI as a trained teacher on 1 Jan 1992. In her 28 years with the school, she has taught both English Language and Literature across all four secondary levels. She possesses sound knowledge in both subjects as evident in her preparation of resources and lesson delivery. She is a kind lady and her gracious words and warm smile will be dearly missed by both students and staff.

  

SJI also bids farewell to our Chaplain,&nbsp;**Friar Michael D'Cruz**&nbsp;who has been appointed as the Parish Priest of St Mary of the Angels (SMOTA) Church from 2 January 2020. With this appointment that carries greater responsibilities, Friar Mike has asked to step down as our Chaplain.

  

Friar Mike has been our Chaplain, teacher, consoler and a friend to many in SJI for the past 18 years. Many of us have become spiritually richer because of his presence and teachings, and the community that he has helped us become. From Inaugural to Thanksgiving assemblies throughout the years, Friar Mike has always reminded us of God's holy presence in our own respective religions, and to treasure the gift of friendship. The SJI community will miss him and his creative paraliturgies dearly, and we wish him all the best as he embarks on his new mission at SMOTA.

#### October: SJI Celebrates with our Class of 2019 Graduates

SJI celebrated with and graduated the largest cohort of 287 students from the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme and 217 boys from the O-level Programme on 10 and 11 October.

 [https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/48934947652/in/album-72157711432187842](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/48934947652/in/album-72157711432187842) 

On the eve of their graduation, the IB Class of 2019 celebrated their last evening of school with "Dusk" - an evening jam, followed by a sunset picnic on the track against the lit facade of SJI. Music jams have been an integral part of these students' life during their college years. In this final jam, they sang their favourite songs together for the last time. At the graduation ceremony, the school honoured 8 outstanding graduands with the Lasallian Distinguished Leadership &amp; Service Awards for their service to the school and community, with&nbsp;**Anastasia Kurniadi**&nbsp;receiving the Spirit of SJI award.

  

The Year 4 graduation ceremony for the O-Level graduands on 11 October saw the return of Mr Ian Luke Chan (Class of 2014) who was the Guest of Honour. Ian had lost vision in his right eye at eight as a result of glaucoma and became completely blind when he was in Secondary 4 in 2014. Despite his visual impairment, Ian's unyielding determination and his sense of humour are an inspiration to many. In his speech, Ian reminded the graduating students to treasure their friendships and to believe in their capacity to be resilient. Nine Lasallian Distinguished Service awards were presented to outstanding students, including the Spirit of SJI award which was presented to&nbsp;**Theodore Tang**. The school's highest honour, the Senior Josephian award, was presented to&nbsp;**James Slade Lim**, while&nbsp;**Alden Ler**&nbsp;was named the SJIOBA Sportsman of the Year.

#### October: Celebrating the Love for Local Poetry

In conjunction with the 3rd SingLit Festival in SJI, we celebrated the love for our local poetry in Term 4. A Poetry Café was set up, where students and teachers were invited to “taste” Singapore poems as though they were part of an “amuse bouche” menu. Our Teacher-Librarian, Mrs Boey Wah Fong, gave a talk on her lifelong “Singapore poetry diet”, and supported classes who booked into the Library for Poetry Reading Circles. The students were also invited to participate in a poetry writing competition.

  

The judges were impressed by the quantity and quality of the poems submitted, which were astonishingly varied in theme, with some displaying outstanding levels of maturity and depth in their reflection. Of all the entries, the judges were particularly moved by “The Observer” by Jeremy Kiang from Year 2, about a young child who is able to empathise with every single member of his dysfunctional family. Jeremy’s achievement shows that youth is no barrier to the ability to observe, think, empathise, and express deep emotions. Here is a stanza from his poem:

 <p style="text-align:center;"><em>And the day after, I gather all the words I won’t say<br>All the feelings I can’t show<br>They are my ammunition,<br>My fingers my guns,<br>These keys my trigger,<br>And I blast a hole in the white screen<br>And tear it apart, watch it fall in tatters to the bottom of the page</em></p> 

Congratulations to the following winners of SJI’s SingLit 2019 Poetry Writing Competition:

#### September: SJI Teams Participate in Science Mentorship Programmes

The Science Mentorship Programmes (SMP) is organised by Ministry of Education, Gifted Education Branch and school-based SMP (SB-SMP) is a subset of the programme where Secondary 3 students embark on research projects under the guidance of their teachers. The SMP culminated in the 25th Youth Science Conference where participants had a chance to showcase their projects and receive authentic feedback from experts of their fields. This year, for the first time the SJI Mathematics Department sent two teams to the SMP, who were mentored by Mr Fong Kok Hoong and Mrs Amy Chua.

  

**Guru Anand Anish**&nbsp;(MN301),&nbsp;**Timothy Tan**&nbsp;(MN301), and&nbsp;**Goh Teng Loong**&nbsp;(ML302) clinched a Bronze for their project on Mathematics in Prediction Models - Predicting Salinity in Oceans.

<img src="![](/images/SB%20SMP2.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

The 9-month long journey is a celebration of the experiential and collaborative learning. Academic rigour and creative productivity are evident in the interdisciplinary nature of their projects. With this programme, the boys acquired vital habits of mind and adhered to strong research ethics in their inquiry. The exchange of ideas with peers, mentors and evaluators at authentic platforms such as Project judging and plenary sessions is invaluable to the boys.

#### September: SJI Conducts Coding Workshop for CHIJ students

<img src="![](/images/Introduction.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

The Coding &amp; Technology CAS held a workshop for 20 Secondary 3 CHIJ (TP) students on 19 September, aimed at exposing them to the basics of programming and 3D computer aided design (CAD).

  

Through programming with Arduino microcontroller, they learnt simple codes to control LED and temperature sensor functions, giving them a glimpse of the purpose and utility of coding in the real world.

  

The girls were also exposed to 3D design using Autodesk Fusion 360. They learned basic functions through creating a CAD model of an android robot. This hands-on learning coupled with a quick view of SJI’s 3D-printer in action allows them to conceptualise their skills, and appreciate the physical fruition of their efforts.

  

Before the end of workshop, Mr Tang Woh Un (Dean, IB Academy) shared with the girls about IBDP at SJI. This is followed by the sharing by an alumnus of CHIJ about her experiences of studying IBDP at SJI.

  

This is what the CHIJ teacher Ms Eulalia Han wrote -

"_It was such a joy for both my students and I to have attended the coding class, which your students have so nicely organised, and to have learnt about the unique IB Diploma programme that your school offers through Mr Tang's sharing. It was also heartwarming to walk around SJI during the tour and see so many CHIJ Secondary girls in the midst and them telling us about their wonderful experiences at SJI thus far_."

August: SJI Team Participates in 21st Chuo International Education Forum in Japan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Morioko trip.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Morioko%20trip.jpg)

Four Year 5 students - Lachlan Neo, Serena Lee and Goh Sze Ying (all from MN519) and Kato Daisuke (ML514) -were selected to participate in the 21st Chuo International Education Forum at Morioka, Japan from 24 August to 4 September. They were selected from the more than a dozen Year 5s who applied for the various exchange programmes. The Forum is a homestay student exchange programme and these Year 5s will be hosting their Japanese counterparts in their homes when they visit SJI in November this year.

  

The theme for this forum was "Think globally and act locally - Transforming our world using the SDGs.” Participants had to find solutions to the challenges of the future: (i) ageing society, (ii) child poverty and (iii) female empowerment that were chosen from the UN SGDs. To enable participants to better understand the situations in different countries, they had to prepare a video on the current situation of ageing, child poverty and female empowerment in their respective countries. This was done prior to the forum and used in classroom visits and discussions during the forum. At the forum, students were divided into groups and members of each group will then discuss the issues and attempt to find common solutions to them. Participants addressed some of the issues relating to the challenges and attempt to explore solutions. Each group made a final presentation based on their findings from the discussions.

  

Accompanied by Ms Alice Wijaya, the students forged new friendships and bonds with their gracious Japanese host families and understood more about their culture, history, and way of life on a day-to-day basis. They were also granted the unique opportunity to meet and get to know students from New Zealand, Argentina, Russia and Vietnam among others. Through collaboration with their peers from these countries, they were able to learn more about their countries and people, as well as forge relationships and create connections with people of different nations and backgrounds. Read more about their personal reflections from the trip here.

  

**Lachlan Neo**&nbsp;(MN519):  
_This experience in Morioka was an experience that I would genuinely want to relive all over again. It is impossible to be able to express my gratitude to my host family, particularly my elderly Host Mother, Shihoko, for this truly amazing experience. I was treated like a son of hers, being incorporated into their family life and welcomed with such unparalleled warmth and hospitality into her home. She taught me the way of life in Japan, be it simple phrases that Japanese people say before eating, to the navigating of the JR East train system in Japan. She truly provided me with an experience that I will never forget. The warmth, love and care that she showed me throughout the week is something that I will never forget. She so graciously welcomed me into her home, being willing to commit to arduous tasks such as waking up early to prepare Bento Boxes and iron clothes for myself and my housemate from Vietnam. Homestay was truly a unique experience and for me, it was the highlight of the trip. I was also able to meet people from different countries all across the globe and learn about them and their culture. To me, working together with International students and undergoing a homestay truly made this experience one to reminisce on in the future and one with many different takeaways. Thank you for allowing me to take part in such a meaningful exchange program to Morioka._

  

**Serena Lee Oh**&nbsp;(MN519):  
_My takeaway from this trip is that for us to truly know a country, we first need to understand its people. At first, I had the impression that I was familiar with Japanese culture, especially since I’ve learnt about Japan in history class and toured the country once. However, I realised that my true understanding of Japanese culture stemmed from conversing with the locals, eating with them and befriending them during the trip. Initially, I was apprehensive about meeting and working with people from entirely different cultures, but at the end of the forum, I realised that it was foolish of me to fear what I had yet to see and know. Early in the trip, I noticed that the lenses I viewed other countries were sometimes tainted, and I needed the help of locals to accurately grasp the situation of their countries. In conclusion, how we perceive other cultures and people should not come from our preconceptions, but through genuine interaction with people. The bonds I’ve forged in Japan are definitely my most treasured takeaways. Although they aren’t tangible, they will live on in my memory and my heart. It has definitely given us clarity in the way we engage others, and we hope to bless the rest of the school community with this valuable experience._

  

**Goh Sze Ying**&nbsp;(MN519):  
_Through this priceless opportunity to represent SJI in the 21st CHUO International Education Forum, I was fortunate to meet a lovely host family who took me in as if I was one of their own and taught me the way of life in Japan. My host mother, Yukiko-san, constantly went out of her way to make me feel welcomed and comfortable, preparing daily bento lunches for me and always including me in family dinner conversations. I was absolutely awestruck by the kindness bestowed upon me, and am looking forward to repaying their kindness and hospitality when they do come on exchange. I was also able to make many international friendships, with students from Argentina, New Zealand, Vietnam and more. It was an eye-opening experience to hear about their country’s situation from their point of view and the past few days have taught me valuable life lessons. I was also reminded not to take Singapore’s safety and good education for granted as I learnt that not everyone abroad has the same opportunities and I am truly blessed to be born into a first-world country. I learnt the importance of having a compassionate and understanding heart after interacting with the forum participants, who shared their worries in regard to their country’s problems with me. This forum has helped me to broaden my horizons and taught me invaluable lessons._

  

**Kato Daisuke**&nbsp;(ML514):  
_It was a very enlightening experience for me, despite the fact that I am half Japanese. This trip has truly allowed me to understand the warm welcoming Japanese sprit as my host family warmly welcomed me into their house for one week. During the trip, I had an invaluable experience where the train service stopped because the train ran over a bear, and my host family gathered those stranded at the station and sent them to school without hesitation. I think this experience has allowed me to look deeper into the Japanese spirit that I have been struggling to comprehend as a half Japanese. I also managed to get a better understanding of the situation in Japan, as my knowledge of Japan previously was constructed around the major cities that are heavily populated, but by visiting less well-known places such as Morioka, I managed to experience life in the rural areas of Japan, such as taking an hour to go to school every day, which has also allowed me to realise small things such as travel time is a privilege. As for the forum, it was a great opportunity for me to get to know better about other countries through the first-hand accounts of other students, and it was eye-opening to see how nationalities can shape a person's point of view. It was also exciting to participate in an event of such a large scale, and I look forward to hosting them in November._

August: Indian Cultural Society Organises Tamil Language Cultural Camp 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

![ICScamp-dance.png](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/ICScamp-dance.png)

The Year 5s of Indian Cultural Society (ICS) conducted a Tamil Language Cultural Camp for their juniors. The theme for this year’s camp was “Aram Seiya Virumbu” which means “Always be ready to serve and help”. It is a famous proverb by one of Tamil Language’s notable poets Avvaiyar and serves as a daily reminder to all of us on the importance of willingly living for others. This is in accordance with our Lasallian principles - to serve the last, the lost and the least. Through many reflections and activities, the students had the opportunity to reflect on their lives of being a true Josephian. The camp also aimed at developing the students’ interest in the Tamil language and culture. They were introduced to Indian spices, traditional games, dances and sports.

August: SJI's Foundation Programme Academy (FPA) Holds Inaugural Science Showcase
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The event on 23 August was for Year 1 and 2 students and it was initiated by the Science Department in the Foundation Programme Academy (FPA). It aimed to give students the opportunity to showcase their project work to the other students in Years 1 and 2, and to share their experiences doing their Science project work.

![FPAScience-bridge2.png](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/FPAScience-bridge2.png)

The boys who presented their projects learnt problem-solving skills, such as managing problems within a project team situation. They also learnt presentation skills such as drafting a project write up and designing a Science Fair poster.

  

The Year 1s designed a bridge from ice cream sticks to withstand a very large load. The boys had to research and design their prototype so that they could get the highest load to weight of bridge ratio before it would break.

![FPAScience-bridge1.png](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/FPAScience-bridge1.png)  

The Year 2s designed a prototype of a Solar Cooker. The objective is to harness the heat from the sun to warm up a beaker of water placed in their prototype. They had to achieve the highest temperature of water placed in the prototype compared to a control set up.

Mr Sirhan Bin Ahmadiah, Head of FPA Science, "It was quite heartening to see the presenters and the audience thoroughly engaged during the showcase, where the presenters had to explain the prototype of their solar cookers or the Bridge and why they were designed as such. The audience also posed many questions at the presenters spontaneously, which require them to think and reflect before they can provide a satisfactory response."

August: SJI Unveils New Heritage Gallery - Missio 1852
------------------------------------------------------

SJI has unveiled 'Missio 1852', a new heritage gallery today, in commemoration of Singapore's bicentennial year and the Tercentenary of the death of the Founder of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools – St. John Baptist de La Salle. The gallery showcases 167 years of Josephian history and Lasallian heritage, tradition and community in Singapore. This project is supported by the National Heritage Board and the Singapore Bicentennial Office.

![Missio1852_0222a.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Missio1852_0222a.jpg)  

La Salle Brother Gregory Thomas Lim, FSC, officiated the opening of Missio 1852 with the ringing of the original brass school bell from the former SJI campus at Bras Basah Road. At 95 years old, he is the oldest La Salle Brother in Singapore and was a former teacher who taught Moral Instruction and Bible Knowledge in SJI and St. Patrick’s School in the 1970s.&nbsp;[Read about his journey as a Lasalle Brother](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/SJI%20in%20the%20news/2019/2019082225-CN-A%20Life%20of%20Lasallian%20Dedication.pdf).

“‘Missio’ is the Latin word for ‘mission’. Being the first Catholic school founded in Singapore, we have chosen this name to remember our beginnings, to celebrate our school and to continue believing in the Catholic, Lasallian education that SJI provides for all Josephians to become people of integrity and people for others”, says Principal Fr. (Dr) Adrian Danker, SJ, an alumnus from Class of 1981.

  

Missio 1852 is open to students and staff during school hours during term time. To celebrate the opening of the Heritage Gallery, Missio 1852 will be open to SJI alumni on 3 Saturdays in August – 17, 24 and 31 August 2019, from 10 am to 2 pm.&nbsp;[Click here for details](https://www.sji.edu.sg/news-and-events/announcements/2019).

July: Josephians Participate in International Humanities Symposium
------------------------------------------------------------------

![NJC-International Humanities Symposium1.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/NJC-International%20Humanities%20Symposium1.jpg)  

Five students - Chen Hao (MN518), Sonya Faye Vohrah (MN516), Tan Zhi Ming Gideon (LE510), Ong Yu Han Natasha (FN504), Nur Nadia Binti Suhaimi(FN503) participated in the International Humanities Symposium at the National Junior College on 19 July. Their participation marked the launch of SJI's Magis Humanities programme. SJI Magis is the school's Talent Development Programme. It invites students to pursue their interests and passions in various academic areas by participating in academic research, workshops, seminars, and conferences under the mentorship of SJI teachers, university academic and industry experts and researchers.

  

The IHS was an insightful and educational event that allowed students to learn more about various subject matters - including Economics, Literature, and Sociology. The theme for this year’s symposium was “Humanities in A Changing World”. The keynote speaker, Professor Theseira from SUSS, spoke about the fake news bill and how that might affect academics who are looking for the objective truth.

  

The NJC students collaborated with foreign students from Australia, Japan and Vietnam to present alternative views on their research project. A session we attended, titled “A comparative study of Singaporean and Australian Children's Literature”, was particularly interesting as the students from NJC and Suzanne Cory High School did an analysis of how literature in Singapore and Australia are constructed according to their respective cultures.

  

Furthermore, on the Singaporean front, the books used for analysis were books we, ourselves, would have read when younger, for example, the Ellie Belly Series, making the analysis all the more personal and intriguing.

  

Chen Hao and Sonya presented on Historical Materialism, which involves looking at history via a Marxist and economical perspective, to learn how economies drive human progress, culture and society. The concept was new to the audience and this sparked their interest in how the theory could be applied to real life. As such, they were very inquisitive, asking many questions, wanting to understand the concept better, in order to learn more. Both of them were very familiar with the content of the presentation, which could be seen from their natural and engaging speaking style.

  

The Symposium was a valuable experience that helped these students to learn about the diverse nature of this area of study and learn about its relevance even in a world where Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are being regarded as more important in this day and age. The variety of humanities topics discussed during the IHS further intrigued them and increased their passion for the humanities.

On 16 July, on the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, our students from the various Catholic societies in SJI – the Legion of Mary, the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Young Christian Students – made their annual pilgrimage to the Carmelite Monastery. Every year, the Year 1 Catholic students, accompanied by older students, take part in the Eucharistic celebration on this day at the monastery as a way of exposing them to a contemplative Order and investing them in the Brown Scapular. Our students also assist with the liturgy of the Mass, taking on the roles of lectors, servers and cantors. The annual pilgrimage is one of our faith formation programmes for our Catholic students.

July: Josephians Achieve Top Awards on Development of Genetically Modified Foods
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two teams comprising of 8 boys presented in the Finals of the Genetic Modification Advisory Committee (GMAC) Students Challenge 2019 - "Development of Genetically Modified Food" on 5 July. The Challenge aims to promote active learning and to stimulate students' interest in science-based GM-related topics. The teams were given the autonomy to choose a genetically modified crop from a given list and to explain how the technology was used to produce the product, including explanations on all the scientific techniques and methods used. The teams completed their work in an infographic poster in the preliminary round and delivered a presentation in the final judging round.

  

The 2 teams achieved the 1st and 4th placing at the Challenge.

![GMAC 1st placing.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/GMAC%201st%20placing.jpg)![GMAC 4th placing.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/GMAC%204th%20placing.jpg)  

The team members and the synopsis of their projects:

  

*   **1st place: AquAdvantage Salmon&nbsp;\- presented by Darren Sim, Ahmad Siddique B Muhamed Abdillah, Gatongay Ryqx Manoza and Chue Zhi Sheng Jeffrey**

![GMAC Team A.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/GMAC%20Team%20A.jpg)The students designed and presented an infographic poster about the Atlantic Salmon that has been genetically modified by AquaBounty Technologies to grow salmon at a faster rate than regular salmon, achieved by using genetic engineering. The method is to splice the DNA responsible for the continuous growth of another species of salmon into the DNA of Atlantic salmon. The project was inspired by the fact that food insecurity is a major problem today, with larger fish species like salmon being especially vulnerable as they reproduce slowly. Thus, AquAdvantage salmon will help to achieve these requirements, with genetically engineered salmon that grow twice as fast as normal Atlantic salmon.

  

*   **4th place: Flavr Savr Tomato&nbsp;\- presented by Chong Jin Qi, Lee Jie Terrence, Lee Jin Timothy and Daniel Yeo Jen Xiang**

![GMAC Team B.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/GMAC%20Team%20B.jpg)The students designed and presented an infographic poster about the development of firm and juicy tomatoes through genetic engineering. Research has shown that an enzyme, polygalacturonase (PG), makes tomatoes soft and squishy, decreasing their shelf life. To counter it, the gene that gives instructions to make the enzyme, polygalacturonase, PG gene, is met with an opposite of the gene. The original gene is known as the DNA sense and the opposite is the antisense. When they are combined it becomes inactivated. This is known as the antisense technology to genetically modify food. The new plant then produces the seed that has the antisense gene. The Flavr Savr tomato is now ready with success in genetic engineering.

June: Learning About Healthy Eating Through Food Science &amp; Innovation Hackathon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By Edward Tan and Kristen Tan  
  

9 Josephians took part in the Phi Life Centre Food Science &amp; Innovation Hackathon on 27 June at Masjid Assyakirin. Jointly organised by SJI and Phi Life Centre, the hackathon aims to bridge the knowledge gap with the marginalised in Singapore and to encourage participants to adopt healthy eating.

  

This is part of SJI’s Class Leaders' Initiative where our Year 5 class leaders work with their classes to determine how they would like to serve the community. The Year 5 Class Leaders – Kristen Tam (LE508) and Edward Tan (MN520) planned the event together with members from Phi Life, Ms Dawn Teo, SJI alumna Ms. Nurin Huda (Class of 2017), Ms. Si Qi Toh and Mr. Nicholas Goh. The students and 8 children of ages 10-13 years old learnt about the digestive system, and the effects of sugar and salt-rich foods on the human body. They played icebreaker games with the children to foster teamwork, and to highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy body. The highlight of the day was a hands-on cooking session for the children under the guidance of two professional chefs.

This is the first time SJI is collaborating with Phi Life Centre. Through the activity, our students gained from the cultural exchange, as most of them have never been to the mosque prior to this event. We hoped that the young participants have learnt about healthy eating in an interactive and fun manner, which will encourage them to embrace a healthy lifestyle in the future.

On 29 May, 2nd Minister of Education, Ms Indranee Rajah, visited SJI, where she had dialogue sessions with students and with members of staff. About 30 students shared with her their ideas about how government policies could best be communicated. When asked about improvements that can be made to the education system, the topic about the awareness of mental well-being was surfaced. The students felt that more could be done to bring about greater awareness, which in turn could bring about greater support to those who faced challenges.

  

With the staff, there was a discussion about various topics which ranged from elevating the proficiency in the English language among students to DSA practices.

May: SJI staged ‘Environmentally Sound’ at the Open Little Eyes Conference
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

By Ms Valerie Koh

  

Our Year 1 and 3 boys from SJI Drama Club staged ‘Environmentally Sound’, an interactive drama performance at the Open Little Eyes Conference organised by Singapore Chinese Girls School. Approximately 300 upper primary students from schools such as SCGS Primary, Radin Mas, Huayi, Pathlight and Chao Yang, as well as homeschoolers attended this conference.

  

The conference aimed to educate upper primary students on the importance of waste management and reduction through hands-on activities. Our performance was designed to raise awareness of these concerns.

  

Our forum theatre piece comprised three short plays focusing on our carbon footprint, food wastage and plastic waste respectively. Students were invited to consider the anti-models of social behaviour in each play and offer solutions. They were then given the option of joining the actors on stage to help change the characters’ minds or having the actors act out their ideas.

  

The primary school students loved their performance and were eager to offer suggestions to solve the problems posed in various scenarios, with a number performing with our students to enact social change.

  

Feedback from the organisers was also positive: our boys were praised for capturing and engaging the audience’s attention. They were also pleased that the boys had touched on significant areas of concern which helped to set the tone for the activities that were to follow. Althan and Iqbal, our Year 3 facilitators, were also commended for their skilful handling of suggestions and responses. Our Year 1 students also demonstrated quick thinking and creativity in their improvised responses based on the students’ ideas.

May: Heartstrings 2019: Everlasting Melodies
--------------------------------------------

By Glenda Goh Ning En and Regine Ng Rui Jing (CEO and Deputy CEO of PRISM 2018/19)

  
![](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Heartstrings.png)  

The Heartstrings Concert is an annual concert by PRISM CAS. It is held in partnership with SPD and Beautiful Mind Charity. After more than six months’ of hard work and meticulous planning, Heartstrings 2019: Everlasting Melodies raised more than $7000, thanks to the generosity of many who have supported our cause.

  

This year, we saw an impressive array of student performers and professional artistes such as Mr Robert Fernando, an esteemed and highly sought after musical legend who charmed the audience with his soulful renditions of classics, as well as his witty banter that brought laughter to the audience. A fervent supporter of Heartstrings is 15-year-old soprano soloist Ms Lauren Yeo who returned to charm us with her powerful vocals for the third year. Heartstrings 2019 also had a special appearance by 14-year-old Asia’s Got Talent semi-finalist Syah Riszuan. Their vocal prowess are proof that age does not limit what you can achieve.

  

SJI’s very own student performers included music band GarageBand, vocals-and-violins collaboration Voila!, Secondary school band Paradize, Chamber ensemble, a flute and piano duo as well as a solo dancer. Mrs Vivian Tan, Director of Learning (IBAM) &amp; Head (Arts) at SJI, who was our special guest performer for the event, surprised the audience with her soprano vocals. She really showed us that talent can be found everywhere, and it exists within ourselves.

  

We also had the privilege of having two performers from Beautiful Mind Charity playing the violin and the cello, who despite the obstacles they faced, are able to overcome them and let their talents shine through.

  

The Heartstrings Concert was a fulfilling experience that taught us the value of finding purpose in what we do. Even though we faced our fair share of setbacks and obstacles, the driving force that kept us going until the end of the concert was knowing that we were contributing to a cause larger than ourselves. We were blessed with different gifts and it is up to us to harness these talents and leave a positive impact on our communities.

May: Literature Comes Alive at SJI's World Literature Festival
--------------------------------------------------------------

By Mr Alan Johnson  
  

The inaugural World Literature Festival (21 - 24 May) at SJI was a roaring success featuring a literary exhibition at the foyer, talks by teachers, a talk by our Principal, performances and theatre performances. The aim of the festival was to share the joy and value of encountering different cultures and ideas through the art of literature. Students and staff were treated to talks on Japanese literature, diasporic literature and post-colonial literature. The Group 2 teachers and students got in on the act with literary performances in Tamil, Malay, Chinese and Spanish. The festival ended on a high note with a series of plays by the Literature and Performance students putting on plays adapted from the prose writing of Haruki Murakami (Japan) and Krys Lee (Korea).

  

In addition to these, the Senior Drama Club put together an original play titled 'The World Theatre Festival' that took the audience on a historical journey through theatre. They performed excerpts from the plays of Sophocles, Moliere, Shakespeare and Brecht. We look forward to more literary engagements next year.

The SJI Malay debaters made history by emerging as overall champions in the 2019 National Malay-language Debate Competition, organized by Bahas 4PM. Their achievement is extra special as this is SJI's first-ever year participating in the pre-university category.

  

The 3-man debate team comprising Nadim B Nazri (TG616), Mohd Rizq Irfandi Bin Zunaidi (TG604) and debate leader Kamal Ashraf Bin Kamil Jumat (TG612), underwent three preliminary debate rounds and the semi-finals before reaching the Finals. The trio engaged in a fierce battle against 2-year defending champions Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah on 8 April 2019 at Mediacorp studio. The debate was telecast on Suria Channel on 28 April 2019.

  

The motion for the final debate was “In the pursuit of economy, history is forgotten”. The SJI team were the opposition. Our debaters successfully defended their stand that “Singapore’s history is not and never forgotten”.

  

Nadim Bin Nazri won the Best Speaker Award in the preliminary round and Mohd Rizq Irfandi Bin Zunaidi clinched the Best Speaker Award and Overall Best Speaker in the finals. The team also won the Hawaizi Daipi Championship Trophy and a $1000 voucher.

  

Special mention goes to two students - Quraish Shoeb Burhanuddin (TG612) and Ryan Ashraf Bin Jefree (TG615) - who did a wonderful job as the team researchers and critics.

April: SJI Community Supports Mitumba Project for Lent
------------------------------------------------------

By Mr Firmin Lee  
  

The annual Lenten project collection is an occasion for the SJI community to participate in our Lenten activity to aid the last, the lost and the least. This year, SJI supported the Tana River Life Foundation (TRLF), a charitable NGO registered in Kenya. It was founded by Gabriel Teo Kian Chong, a Malaysian and former Singapore resident who has been living in Kenya since 1995. TRLF’s vision is to build a more just and honest society, by promoting affordable quality education, sustainable agricultural projects, integral formation of youth and community-based entrepreneurship programmes.

  

The SJI Lenten project was to support the TRLF's Mitumba Project (or “recycled goods” in Kiswahili). The collection of items through the SJI community will aid the educational projects run by TRLF through the sales of these items to help support families with school-going children.

  

By the end of the Lenten project, SJI had collated about 70 bags of clothes and shoes for the Mitumba Project, which were delivered to the TRLF team at the Church of Holy Cross.

April: Josephians Celebrate Resurrection of Christ on Easter Monday
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Josephians were welcomed with a blessing on Easter Monday, as the school community gathered to celebrate Easter, the resurrection of Jesus. The students were given Easter eggs that symbolise new life.

April: Josephians Commemorate the Lord's Supper on Maundy Thursday
------------------------------------------------------------------

On Maundy Thursday, Christians remember Jesus washing his disciples’ feet. We celebrate His command to go and do likewise. We believe Jesus’ command is our mandate for Christian life - to serve others.

  

In school on 18 April, we were reminded that service is the soul of SJI. Why we exist as a Catholic, Lasallian school and how we live and work as Josephians are embodied in lives of service. Our SJI way strives to imitate Jesus’ way of serving all.

  

Our Catholic community celebrated the Mass of the Lord's Supper and witnessed the washing of feet that Maundy Thursday evening before they went off for church visitation in the night. The Catholic students kept vigil for the night which concluded with a Good Friday service the next morning.

March:&nbsp;SJI Bids Farewell to Retiring Vice-Principal Mrs Goh Poh Kenn
--------------------------------------------------------------------

![GPK-IMG_4641.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/GPK-IMG_4641.JPG)  

Mrs Goh Poh Kenn has retired on 31 March after 27 years of outstanding and exemplary service in SJI. She joined SJI on 1 January 1992 and has proven to be a natural leader who has the drive to lead others. She has held several key leadership positions in SJI. In 1999, she was appointed Assistant Principal (Curriculum/Projects), where she consistently set high standards for the school and contributed positively and effectively to the education of our students over many years. She was also instrumental in initiating, conceptualising and implementing the school’s IT programme and infrastructure under MOE’s IT Masterplan.

  

In 2002, Mrs Goh was nominated for the Leaders in Education Programme (LEP). She was awarded The Lee Kuan Yew LEP Award for being the best participant in that Class for achieving the best overall performance. On completion of the LEP, Mrs Goh was promoted to Deputy Principal (Curriculum) on 1 January 2003. As DPC, she effectively planned, implemented and reviewed the school’s overall curriculum programme. She is well respected by fellow professionals for her dedication, commitment and service to education and the school.

  

She steered the school in preparation for external validation (EV) of the school’s processes and outcomes conducted by MOE’s External Validation team and the SPRING Singapore. The school was well validated and attained the Singapore Quality Class in 2004 and the Best Practice Award (Teaching &amp; Learning) in 2005. Mrs Goh also played a pivotal role in SJI getting the School Excellence Award in 2008.

  

She was awarded the National Day honours of Long Service Medal in 2006 and Public Administration Medal (Bronze) in 2007 by the President of the Republic of Singapore in recognition of her outstanding work over the years.

  

She was appointed as Vice-Principal (Administration) in 2018 to coordinate and streamline the school’s various administrative processes which include student services, facilities, general administrative support, school safety and emergency planning. She leaves behind a solid foundation for her successor to continue improving the school’s administration services in the coming years.

  

In her final assembly address to the school on 25 March, Mrs Goh described Josephians as beautiful people who have a good understanding of what it is to be compassionate as well as a sensitivity and a deep loving concern for others, especially the last, the lost and the least.&nbsp;[Read her full address here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qhfksjlXqbM6nE07rd8efqHXoURVwil/view?usp=sharing).

March: Book Week Myths Shattered
--------------------------------

By Mr Azhar Ghazali (Committee member, Book Week 2019)

  

**_Myth 1: The library is a quiet and peaceful place._**

Truth: The haunting chants of the Witches of Macbeth were clearly heard emanating from the bowels of the library. The spirit of Shakespeare truly lives on.

![Readathon.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Readathon.jpg)  

_**Myth 2: Book Week is about books only.**_

Truth: It’s also about how the illustrations and pictures bring a book to life, not just the written words. Anngee Neo combines Art with appreciating good books.

  

**_Myth 3: You are what you Read._**

Truth: You are what you eat as well. The fusion foods provided by the PSG proves just that. Food for thought and tummies.

![Sampling future food bites.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Sampling%20future%20food%20bites.jpg)  

And so ends another week of lively activities for the bibliophiles among us. From Readathons to movies and competitions, there was a motley of events that turned our usually tranquil library into a place full of hurly-burly. There’s always something new to discover and rediscover about the Joys of Reading. We are glad to observe the enthusiastic responses displayed by our students. The activities that were specially planned created plenty of opportunities for both teachers and students to develop and share their love for books and reading.

![Learning about food dehydration techniques.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Learning%20about%20food%20dehydration%20techniques.jpg)  

If you had missed some of the action this time round, fret not. More excitement is brewing in our cauldron with concoctions to entice you further in the near future. Do join us again in The Library.

March: Jobs Alike - A TOK seminar for IB teachers
-------------------------------------------------

On 7 March, SJI hosted a meeting of the Theory of Knowledge (TOK) Network for Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. Over 30 teachers from local and international IB schools joined our SJI TOK staff to dissect, analyse and evaluate the newly released prescribed essay titles.

![TOK-2019-03-07-18-08-47.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/TOK-2019-03-07-18-08-47.jpg)  

The essay is worth two-thirds of the student’s grade in TOK, which, along with their Extended Essay grade, can add three bonus points to their final IB Diploma score. The ideas raised and the discussions held will continue to support all teachers and their students in arguably the most academically challenging assessments the IB students will face.

![TOK-2019-03-07-18-08-54.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/TOK-2019-03-07-18-08-54.jpg)

March: No One Fights Cancer Alone
---------------------------------

By Chloe Lye (TG601) and Jhunne Philippe A Elasigue (TG607)

![Relay for Life.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Relay%20for%20Life.jpg)  

A total of 263 Josephians participated in the Relay for Life at the National Stadium on 1 and 2 March. There was a spirit of passion and camaraderie among the Year 5 and Year 6 students who resolved to complete the 100km run. Everyone contributed to the collective goal by running, regardless of the distance they could manage. Irrespective of the number of laps each one ran, the SJI contingent was never short of people who were eager to lend their help throughout the 15-hour relay. Everyone also participated in concurrent activities with enthusiasm. One of the most memorable moments of the event was the Year 6s, clad in green tutus, actively dancing along to the Zumba performances that were being held at the centre of the stadium. The experience was memorable, especially for the Year 5s.

  

Joshua Lim (MN520) recounted how he felt “a strong motivation throughout the relay” and felt assured he was “working alongside many other people, towards the same objective and fighting for the same cause.” He hopes to take part in future Relay for Life events.

![Relay for Life-IMG_1527.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Relay%20for%20Life-IMG_1527.JPG)  

2019 marked the second attempt at the event for a number of the Year 6s, including Nathan Law (TG601). As someone who is acquainted with victims of cancer, he says, “I would like to play a more active role in supporting and spreading awareness of the effects of cancer.” He was heartened by the genuine messages written in support of victims and their caregivers.

  

The Year 5 cohort was placed twelfth overall based on their timing for completing 100km, while the Year 6 students emerged fourth. The seniors also covered a total distance of 172 km - the second highest overall distance that was run/walked.

  

These achievements pale in comparison however, to the wholehearted and collaborative effort invested by the SJI students to support the celebration of life and to stand in solidarity with cancer patients and their loved ones.

February: Josephian Wins the Orator’s Trophy
--------------------------------------------

  

On 16 February, SJI participated in the Orator’s Trophy, a National Oratorical Competition organised by Anglo-Chinese Junior College. The Orator’s Trophy seeks to provide an avenue for students to develop their spontaneous speaking skills and to build confidence in a public presentation. It also encourages the creative and persuasive use of the English Language.

  

![Dinesh John Peeris(LE203).png](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/Dinesh%20John%20Peeris(LE203).png)All speeches were impromptu and participants only had 5 minutes to prepare before they had to speak for a minimum of 2-3 minutes. The participants were judged on Content, Delivery and Language. Dinesh John Peeris (LE203) did SJI proud by beating 45 other participants from many other schools to emerge as Champion in the Junior League. Elliot Snodgrass (MN517) and Premshan Christopher Singh (ML301) also represented SJI in the Pre-U and Senior League respectively.

  

In a Thank-you note to the teachers who helped to prepare the students for this competition, Dinesh said, “_I am extremely grateful for all the hard work and long days that has been put in towards my training for the Oratory Tournament 2019. My win for the junior category truly belongs to you, I could never have done this without all your help. Thank you and God bless._”

February:&nbsp;The Istana Heritage Gallery Challenge 2019
----------------------------------------------------

Alden Chew Jing Hong (LE203) was one of the 18 Year 2 students chosen to participate in the Istana Heritage Gallery (IHG) Challenge on 22 February. He shares his learning experience from this trip:

  

“This compact but informative gallery taught us about how the Istana began as the Government House. It was built on a nutmeg plantation owned by Charles Prinsep. I then understood that Prinsep Street was named after him. The IHG explained the transition of the post-independence period when emblems associated with the British colonial power were replaced by the new nation’s symbols of sovereignty such as the Istana, the state crest, the presidential standard and the presidential crest. The visit to the IHG allowed me to understand the three roles of the presidential – constitutional, ceremonial and community.

  

My team of 6 competed in three challenges – building a house of cards, making as many stars as we can from quilling strips and taking a photograph that is most iconic of the Istana. My favourite was the photo-taking as it tested us on what we have learnt about the Istana and also allowed our creativity to take over. The meaning of the games was quite surprising as we originally had little idea of their purpose. We later realised they were linked to the work of the President and the Istana. The time spent at the IHG allowed me to bond with my team.”

The session was chaired by Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister, Prime Minister’s Office, and Second Minister for Finance and Education and Mr Sam Tan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Social and Family Development, and REACH Chairman.

  

The students seized the opportunity to interact with the chairpersons on issues close to their hearts. The chairpersons expressed their happiness to see the participation of our students in the discussions.

February:&nbsp;What It Means To Be A Josephian
-----------------------------------------

For the 4th year, the SJI Old Boys’ Association organised the talk for alumni to share with the new Year 1 boys on ‘What It Means To Be A Josephian’. The session on 21 February aims to help Year 1 students to appreciate the rich heritage of SJI and inspire them to become exemplary Josephians.

  

Choo Yi Ming (ML101) shared, “_The arrival of alumnus Mr Han Chi Teng (Class of 1990) in the classroom was met with both anticipation and excitement. Mr Han who is currently a Financial Services Director spoke on what it meant to be a Josephian. After spending six years in a Lasallian school and having listened to many of such talks, I was a little sceptical. However, Mr Han’s talk was very meaningful. In a nutshell, he told us about how we should cherish the time in SJI as this is where we will encounter many challenges and it will be our friends in school who will brave them with us._”

February:&nbsp;A Visit to the PSA
----------------------------

36 Economics students and teachers participated in the PSA’s Port Tour on 19 February. The tour began at the PSA Head office, with the viewing of their corporate video and a Q&amp;A session with Mr Goh Mia Hock, Head of Group Process Excellence and his team from PSA. They then embarked on a tour to the Pasir Panjang Terminal, where they had the rare opportunity to observe how the PSA solves the logistical complexities of moving millions of its TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) through its port by leveraging on advanced technologies and developing innovative port solutions for its customers.

  

The students also visited the PSA Living Lab to preview PSA’s future Tuas Mega Port, which will be Singapore’s next-generation port. They saw the testing of the automated guided vehicles (AGV) that will transfer containers within the port in the future. The tour ended on high note with everyone gaining a deeper understanding of PSA’s reputation as a world-class company and a compelling port of choice for global shipping lines.

February:&nbsp;Welcoming the Year 5s at Orientation Week and Campfire
----------------------------------------------------------------

The new Year 5s bonded with their new friends over a week-long orientation programme, to learn more about SJI and their new learning environment. Organised by the 6th Senior Student Council, Mr Christopher Ngoh and Ms Hazel Ho, the students experienced SJI’s rich history and traditions during the Heritage Challenge that was held within SJI and at her former campus at Bras Basah (now known as Singapore Art Museum). The students also had fun with the games during The Odyssey and a silent reflection on the experiences they went through during the week. The highlight was the campfire on 13 February, as the freshmen sang and cheered their hearts out throughout the night. Welcome to SJI, Year 5s!

February: SJI Commemorates&nbsp;Tercentenary of Founder at Inaugural Assembly
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Inaugural Celebration is our first formal school assembly where the entire school community gathers for the beginning of a new academic year. It is an occasion when the school comes together to celebrate its sense of being a Lasallian community. Josephians gather at this assembly as a praying Lasallian community, remembering the presence of God and adoring the Will of God for SJI in the new academic year.

  

At this celebration, we officially welcome the newest addition to the school – our students from Years 1 and 5, and the Year 3 Scholars, as well as members of the teaching and non-teaching staff. The school also officially acknowledges all the student leaders who have been appointed to formal leadership positions at this assembly, where they take the pledge of leadership through service before the school community.

  

The event also commemorated #300Lasalle - the 300th anniversary of the death of our founder, Saint John Baptist De La Salle. 2019 has been declared a Jubilee Year, which began on 17 November 2018 with the dedication of the sanctuary of Saint John Baptist de la Salle at the Generalate in Rome, and will conclude on 31 December 2019, the end of the Tercentenary and Year of Lasallian Vocations.

  

The inaugural assembly concluded with the distribution of ang-pows with a #300Lasalle keychain to all the students and oranges to the staff before the community was dismissed for an early reunion on Chinese New Year eve.

January:&nbsp;YoungXHUSH Speaks
--------------------------

Summer Yu-Ning Walters (TG617) shares her experience at the “YoungXHUSH Speaks: Inspiration for Action” organised by Hush Teabar, which she attended with Matthew Chang (TG607) on 16 January.

![YoungXHUSH.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2019/YoungXHUSH.jpg)  

“We heard many inspiring stories from individuals, one of whom was Mr Barney Swan who trekked to the South Pole at the age of 23. His accomplishment was astounding as it was the very first expedition that relied only on renewable energy. Through him, we learnt about the importance of self-reflection, and the need to be mindful of our actions. Other speakers shared about initiatives they were taking to spread the importance of mental health.

  

As representatives of the YoungXHUSH community in SJI, we had the opportunity to share about our development as a movement, and our plans to spread the importance of mindfulness to other students, beginning with the Secondary 1 students in SJI. Having gained inspiration from this event, we want to persevere in our endeavours to spread awareness and the practice of mindfulness within SJI.”

I wish to thank all our teachers, Heads, Dean and VPs for their good work, dedication and passion, who gave so much of themselves to help our students do well. They are the secret of SJI's success: their care and love for our students have made all the difference!_”

Four students were also awarded the prestigious Bilingual Diploma.

  

67% of the cohort (180 students) attained at least 40 points out of 45, of which 41% (111 students) scored 42 points or better. A quarter of our cohort (25%) achieved 43 points and better.

  

The Class of 2018 includes our pioneer batch of 135 boys who were admitted to SJI at Secondary 1 in 2013 under the Integrated Programme. The results achieved by our Class of 2018 is evident of a trend that the SJI IBDP relates well with students who enjoyed high academic expectations from the programme. They have found joy in learning by being risk-takers who pursue their interests and passion instead of being rote-learners.

  

Fr (Dr) Adrian Danker, SJ, Principal of SJI, says “_I am extremely delighted with the results achieved by this cohort. They include our first through-train batch of boys who were with us since Secondary 1 under our Integrated Programme. Their good results are a testimony to the quality of our programmes at SJI. More importantly, they affirm our school’s commitment to providing an education that allows our students to achive good results along with a balanced life. The very good result also testify to the excellent teachers we have - competent and caring educators. I am proud of them and the quality of their teaching._.”

  

As a Catholic and Lasallian school, SJI is committed to developing every student’s character and to helping them realize their academic potential, so that they become men and women whose education empowers them to make a positive difference in the world. The IBDP results of the 2018 cohort are an affirmation of the quality of the balanced and holistic education offered at SJI.
