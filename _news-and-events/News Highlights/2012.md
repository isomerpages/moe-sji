#### November: Donors work with SJI to establish new scholarships to support talented and needy students

With the launch of the Dual Track ‘O’ Level and IP education and the new IB Diploma Programme at SJI in 2013, the school has worked with several generous benefactors to establish new scholarships and bursaries to support talented students as well as those with financial need. These scholarship and bursary scheme will enable SJI to hold to its commitment that no student shall be denied a place at SJI because of financial reasons.

The SJI Secondary School Scholarships are for boys joining SJI Secondary 1 in 2013 in either the ‘O’ Level or IP track.

Under the Secondary Scholarships, the SJI OBA (Old Boys’ Association) has committed to giving&nbsp;**SJIOBA Scholarships**&nbsp;to the top-scoring PSLE boy in each of the four Lasallian Primary Schools – SJI Junior, De La Salle, St Anthony’s, and St Stephen’s – who attends secondary school at SJI. Also, Mr Danny Yong (SJI Class of 1988) has established the&nbsp;**Yong Hon Kong Scholarships**, named in honour of his father (also an alumni). In addition, new scholarships for boys from the Lasallian primary schools, as well as boys from other primary schools in Singapore, have also been established under the&nbsp;**SJI Scholarships Fund**.

For the SJI Senior School (the pre-university section), a benefactor has committed to sponsoring scholarships for SJI boys to continue their education at SJI in the IBDP, and also merit bursaries for talented students with financial need from SJI and other secondary schools. Established as the&nbsp;**JC Scholarships and Merit Bursaries for the SJI IBDP**, this scheme aims to encourage and enable more boys and girls to benefit from the values-centred and holistic education at SJI in its new IBDP.

SJI looks forward to working with more stakeholders to ensure to support students in their growth and learning.

#### September: Bidding Farewell to the Class of 2012

<img src="![](/images/speech.jpeg)"  
style="width:65%">

In keeping with SJI tradition, the school community bid farewell to the graduating Class of 2012 with the Farewell Paraliturgy and the Speech and Graduation Day.

  

The Farewell Paraliturgy on 27 September at the Founders’ Hall started with a prayer and lighting of the candle by the Principal and the Class Committee Chairmen of each class. Highlights of the event included the students’ reflection on their four-year journey in SJI, and the presentation of the graduation badge by the Class Tutors to each of their students. The event came to a rousing close with the Class Tutors taking the stage with the song “Passing on the Passion”.

  

The Speech and Graduation Day 2012 on 29 September was graced by Professor Leo Tan (Class of 1963), President and Fellow, Singapore National Academy of Science. Known to be one of the most endearing and touching events of the year, this year’s Speech and Graduation Day was no different. One special moment was when parents read the letters their sons had written to them, sharing about their growth journey and expressing their gratitude to their parents.

  

In his speech, Dr Koh Thiam Seng, Principal of SJI, paid tribute to a special young man, Tan Ser Yung from Class 435. In April 2010, Ser Yung met with an accident during the National Inter-school Judo Competition, which left him partially paralysed. With love and support from his family and the SJI community, he returned to school in 2011 to continue his studies. Ser Yung, who scored an A1 in the GCE ‘O’ levels Chinese paper, has been an inspiration to many and especially so for the Class of 2012.

  

As SJI bids the Class of 2012 adieu, the school community prays for the boys’ success at the coming GCE ‘O’ Level Examinations, and that they will follow the lead of the generations of Josephians before them - to serve society as Men of Integrity and Men for Others.

<img src="![](/images/career.jpeg)"  
style="width:65%">

More than 30 old boys from different walks of life returned to their alma mater to participate in this year’s career talk on 14 September 2012. Organised for the Secondary 4 boys, the event provided a platform for the boys to hear from their seniors on their choice of profession, as the students themselves begin to think of their own.

  

This year, the speakers were organised into 10 groups, namely, law, banking investment &amp; finance, design, religious, medical, public service, education, entrepreneur, bio-research and technology.

  

Head Prefect of SJI, Brandon Krygsman from Class, 431 shared that, “Well, I can’t say that I definitely know what I want to be in the future but the career talk has given me insights on how I can contribute to the community in the future. It’s really heartening to see that Josephians all over are contributing to the community in their own ways and they are still willing to come back just to help us out.”

#### September: Charity Golf &amp; Dinner 2012

<img src="![](/images/golf.jpeg)"  
style="width:65%">

The SJI Old Boys Association (OBA) will be holding the 2012 Charity Golf &amp; Dinner on 15 November at the Singapore Island Country Club. SJI alumnus Mr Peter Seah, Chairman of DBS Group Holdings Ltd and DBS Bank Ltd, will be gracing the event, which aims to raise funds for The Lasallian Scholarship and the SJI Building Fund.

  

<u>_The Lasallian Scholarships_ </u><br>
The Lasallian Scholarship, sponsored by the SJI OBA, will support the top boy of each of the four Lasallian Primary Schools - De La Salle School, St Joseph’s Institution Junior, St Anthony’s School, St Stephen’s School - to pursue their education at SJI. Valued at up to $4,800 each, the scholarships will be automatically offered to the top boy of each of these four schools, based on the results of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). SJI will also waive the annual supplementary fees of $600 or $960 for the O-level track and IP track respectively for the scholarship recipients.

  

<u>_SJI Building Fund_</u><br>
From 2013, SJI will be offering a dual-track education comprising the O-levels, and an Integrated Programme (IP), which leads to the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma in a new SJI JC. As a dual-track school, SJI will be more accessible and cater to a wider range of academic abilities than a full IP school.

  

To cater to this development, the SJI Malcolm Road campus will be expanded to cater for the new JC, and the current facilities will be refurbished. When the works are completed in 2016, the recreational facilities and social spaces will be open, in the evenings and on weekends, to alumni, parents and other stakeholders to socialize and reconnect with one another and with the school.

style="width:65%">

A total of 48 parents participated in the Cyber Wellness workshop organised by the SJI PSG Learning &amp; Development Committee on 19 May 2012. The workshop was led by Mr Anthony Yeong, a counsellor from TOUCH Cyber Wellness. This session was indeed an eye-opening experience as it highlighted the language used, the colour, breadth and vibrancy of today's cyber world. Stories of youths were shared, who started gaming as a form of leisure which became detrimental as they started to spend more time and money to increase powers and levels in their games. He also shared about the risks of online social networking and taught useful tips on how to increase the privacy levels as well as how to spot and stop cyber-bullying. Many parents felt that the talk helped allay their concerns of their children’s cyber addiction. It also involved an online real time practical demonstration and a slideshow on notes and useful assessment tools to detect the onset of cyber addiction.

  

Parents also had the opportunity to network with other parents and clarify issues with the facilitator as well as the school counsellors, Ms Christine Tang and Mr Lee Seng Teck.

#### February: Lent at SJI

The Lent Project is an annual project by the Religious, Moral and Social Education (RMSE) department to help develop and sensitize the conscience of our students in the overall process of developing them to becoming men of integrity and men for others. It forms part of the Community and Social Justice component of the RMSE programme.

  

Each level will be introduced to a segment of the community that the RMSE department has identified as in need of greater awareness and help by the SJI community. As part of the students’ learning, they are invited to act in response to what they have learnt and reflected on.

  

This response is reflected in them setting a portion of their daily expenses to buy items to support the organization they have been introduced.

  

The four organizations for each level are as follows:

#### February: SJI Soccer Makes Creditable Comeback
 
 <img src="![](/images/soccer_2012.jpeg)"  
style="width:65%">

**[SJI Soccer](https://sites.google.com/a/sji.edu.sg/sji-football-team/home)**&nbsp;has made a comeback after a 13-year hiatus with a creditable showing at the 'C' Division Championships. Coached by Mr Kadir Yahya, the assistant coach of the Singapore Lions XII, this team of mostly Sec 1 boys bowed out of the South Zone Competition last week. It was heart breaking for the young boys of this newly formed team, but with only about a month of preparation prior to the tournament, and playing against older boys, their record of not losing a single match is strong encouragement for their future in the game.

  

Principal, Dr. Koh who was present at the final game, was impressed with the boys’ sportsmanship and fighting spirit.

#### February: Inaugural SJI Model United Nations 2012

SJI successfully organised its inaugural SJI Model United Nations (SJIMUN) conference from 10-11 Feb 2012, featuring student delegations from eight schools: Anglo-Chinese School Independent, Hwa Chong Institution, National Junior College, Raffles Girls’ School, Singapore Chinese Girls’ School, St Nicholas Girls’ School, Victoria School and SJI.

<img src="![](/images/SJIMUN_2012.jpeg)"  
style="width:65%">  

The Model UN is a platform for youths to exercise skills of diplomacy, negotiation and problem-solving promoting global citizenship. At SJIMUN 2012, student delegates discussed issues such as North Korea, the prosecution of political and military leaders for crimes against humanity and foreign aid and intervention in post-revolutionary states in the Middle-East. A special feature of the SJIMUN was that the number of council representation was kept small, which gave the delegates greater debate time and interactions not possible in big councils.

  

This SJIMUN 2012 was a student effort initiated by seven Josephians from the Graduation Class of 2011 who believed in promoting youth awareness of and involvement in global issues. The organizing team consist of Azfer Khan, Leonard Yip, Rabin Kok, Gregary Gunawan, Jonathan Leong, Surya Bhat, James Cyriac and Yu Kai Yan who are now in JC.

  

Mr Gerard Ee, Chairman of the SJI Board of Governors, graced the occasion as Guest of Honour for the closing and prize giving ceremony. He shared with participants his personal experiences on volunteerism and community work, and entertaining their questions on community work in Singapore.

#### January: Inaugural Celebration to mark the start of the Academic Year 2012

On Monday, 16th January, SJI held its Inaugural celebration to mark the beginning of the new school year. Friar Michael (SJI Chaplain) celebrated Mass with Catholic staff and students in the Performing Arts Centre (PAC) at the beginning of the day. This was followed with a school assembly in the Founder’s Hall.

style="width:65%">  

Principal Dr Koh Thiam Seng opened his speech by warmly welcoming new and returning students, teachers and staff back to school for the academic year 2012. Dr Koh first spoke about Aaron Tan from class 303), who was commended by a member of the public, Dr Angela Chong, for helping her lost elderly father find his way home. After sending the 85-year-old man, who is hearing impaired, off in a cab, he even called to make sure that his son knew that he needed to be home to receive his father. The man’s daughter, who wrote the letter, congratulated the school for producing "such a fine young gentleman with a good head on his shoulders and the right values in life" despite him being just 14.

  

Much to the delight of the school body, Dr Koh declared the day after the Chinese New Year as a school holiday in celebration of the SJI’s best-ever ‘O’ Level Results in 2011. He extended his appreciation to the graduating class of 2011 for their hard work, and also to the teachers who had worked even harder than the students to get them ready for the big exam. He urged the 2012 Secondary 4s to live up to the legacy of their predecessors and do SJI proud at the national examinations this year. Dr Koh also expressed optimism about the rising standard of academic development as the school starts the IP/IB programme next year.

  

The Principal closed by urging the school to continue to work hard in all areas of activity and study and continue to uphold the Lasallian values which are significant to the school.

#### Jan : Senior Josephian of the Year 2011

Yu Kai Yan graduated from St Stephen’s Primary with a PSLE T-score of 261. At SJI, he committed himself to his CCA, Track and Field, and was recognised for his leadership potential as early as Sec 1 when he was made Class Chairman. The following year, he was appointed as school Prefect.

 <img src="![](/images/Senior%20Joe_2011.jpeg)"  
style="width:65%"> 

Kai Yan epitomises the Lasallian value of service and has shown himself to be a student leader. He puts others and the school before himself and displays a strong commitment to fulfilling his role as the 2011 Head Prefect. His contributions to the school go beyond organising the SJI Carnival, Sec 1 Orientation, and facilitating the Lasallian Leadership Training Camps. In fact, Kai Yan has contributed to the school in many intangible ways. He has shown in thought, word and deed what it is to be a true Lasallian and Josephian.

  

Kai Yan is well respected by his peers. Throughout his four years in SJI, he has remained unassuming and humble, and a good friend and classmate who is always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need.

  

What is most striking about Kai Yan is his mature approach to life, good sense and a set of very sound values that guide his actions. He always has the interest of others at heart and has dedicated much of his time to helping the school and his peers. What he does is done out of service for others and never for self glory. His service and dedication to the school is highly commendable.

  

Kai Yan graduated from SJI with an impressive 8A1s at the GCE O level examinations. He is now at SJI International pursuing an IB Diploma.

January: Dual Junior Josephians
-------------------------------

![dsc002355.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2012/2012%20News%20SJI/dsc002355.jpg)

The Junior Josephian Award is presented to a Sec 2 student who has displayed all-round excellence in academia and co-curricular activities, while at the same time being a man of integrity and service to others. For the first time in 2011, two Junior Josephians were selected instead of one. They are Russell Yip and Hubert Yeo both from class 333.

  

Russell Yip En Shen came to SJI with a PSLE score of 262 from St. Anthony’s Primary School. In secondary one, as a new student, Russell already showed that he is capable of greater responsibilities when he stepped forward to help organize the class. As a junior prefect in Sec 2, he served his fellow schoolmates with humility and sincerity. Moreover, he is able to balance his academic and co-curricular activities well. His consistent good results are a testimony to his keen desire to learn and excel.

  

Hubert Yeo shows that a young man can excel in all pursuits, while being a man of integrity at heart. As a canoeist, he attained a Silver medal for the C1 500m and a Gold medal for the C2 500m at the National Interschool Canoe Championships. He also topped his cohort academically in Sec 1, while maintaining stellar results throughout Sec 2. As admirable as these achievements are, they are but small accolades to Hubert’s person. He was born to lead; devoted to family and friends; he is Lasallian. Despite his drive in his commitments at school, he still prioritises family, never missing a family function. He also helps his friends on his own accord.

Both Russell and Hubert have made us proud with their strong sense of values and their achievements.

These attributes distinguish him from just another high calibre student. As a school prefect, he has discharged his duties well and is a leader who commands respect from his peers and one who all can identify with. He willingly serves and takes on additional responsibilities without having a formal portfolio and is very much remembered for the pivotal role he played in Project Scubillion, a class-based community service project.

  

Rabin’s outstanding achievement in the SJI Debating Team is a clear testament to his commitment and passion. Despite winning a place in the Singapore National Debate Team, he has remained humble and grounded.

  

**Peter**&nbsp;is a dynamic student who clearly displays the school values of faith, service and community. He is a charismatic ad confident leader who has earned the respect of his peers and has, on many occasions, gone beyond the call of duty.

  

Peter also shows integrity in his actions and exhibits compassion towards the needs. He is very helpful towards his classmates and peers and has helped many of his friends and classmates who are weak in their studies. In the four years he has spent at SJI, Peter has shown selfless leadership and utmost dedication to serve.

  

**Surya**&nbsp;is a remarkable Josephian who demonstrates tenacity and resilience. He is an outstanding leader who is always the first to accept responsibilities and the last to claim credit. He adheres to his principles and completes tasks assigned to him to the best of his ability.

  

Surya has held a number of key leadership appointments at various levels, serving as a member of the Prefectorial Board, the Indian Cultural Society and the CSM of the NPCC at SJI. He demonstrates remarkable leadership skills and abilities for a person of his age.

  

**James**&nbsp;served in the Prefectorial Board and was a Peer Support Leader and Facilitator. He involved himself enthusiastically in orientation programmes and camps for his juniors. He possesses sound moral values and can be counted on to be fair and just in carrying out his duties.

  

As a member of the class, James is extremely supportive of all class events. He is not one to hesitate putting forth suggestions to promote class spirit. It is with this same fervour that he helps his classmates who are weaker in their studies. He has gained the respect from his peers for his sincerity, kindness and generosity with his time.

January: SJIOBA Sportsman of the Year 2011
------------------------------------------

![Sportsman 2011.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2012/2012%20News%20SJI/Sportsman%202011.JPG)

Karthic Harish Ragupathy joined SJI from St. Anthony’s Primary School. He displayed a natural talent for Track and Field even at Sec 1. He has a running record of 1.6km in 6.18mins at the young age of 12. At Sec 2 he was crowned Champion at the National Inter-School Cross Country Championships. In that year he also won the 3rd placing for the 1500m at the National Inter-School Track &amp; Field Championships.

  

At Sec 3, competing against the bigger boys in ‘B’Division, he managed a very respectful 3rd position at the Cross Country Championships and won Gold at the 3000m Track event. In 2011, he was crowned Champion for the second time at the National Cross Country Championships and retained the gold for the 3000m event.

  

This achievement earned him a place in the team that represented Singapore in the inaugural Asian Schools Cross Country Championship in Mongolia. Competing against Asian giants such as China, Iran, Mongolia, and in the harsh terrain at 1368m above sea level, he achieved a very commendable 13th position, helping the Singapore team to achieve an overall third position.

  

All these did not come easy, behind these accolades there is sheer hard work, discipline and plenty of sacrifice. Despite all these successes, he still remains down to earth never forgetting all those who had helped him achieve so much.
