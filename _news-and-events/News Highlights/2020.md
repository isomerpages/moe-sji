#### December: Re-opening of Wallace Exhibition and Trail at Dairy Farm Nature Park

In 2018, St Joseph’s Institution (SJI) collaborated with the National Parks Board (NParks) through the Lived English Experience Programme (LEEP) in an effort to attract visitors to the Dairy Farm Nature Park by creating a more immersive and enriching experience for visitors. Through a shared vision between NParks (nature conservation to create the best living conditions in Singapore by transforming it into a city in nature), and SJI’s English and Language Department (empowering students through authentic experiences in language), Integrated Programme (IP) students in Year 3 saw the possibilities in the application of language and literature to real world issues. The students' proposal to NParks saw the birth of the Lit on Life (LOL) project.

  

With a year in intensive development, the greater part of 2019 was invested in the development of three programmes. These were eventually presented to NParks in November 2019 and they were very well received. The plan was for the projects to be handed over to NParks and implemented on a national basis after the NParks bicentennial opening of the nature parks in Singapore in mid-2020. The students continued to refine and work on their programmes based on the feedback they received for their presentations at the re-opening of the Wallace Exhibition. However, due to the unfortunate pandemic crisis and Singapore’s implementation of the circuit breaker in 2020, their presentations were delayed to the end of 2020. Eventually, on 7 December 2020, our Josephians showcased their work at the reopening of the Wallace Exhibition and Trail at the Dairy Farm Nature Park.

  

The reopening exhibition saw our students reap the rewards of their hard work. The host of the event was Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration. Amongst the 50 guests attending the Wallace exhibition were Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Advisor to Holland-Bukit Timah GRC; Professor Leo Tan, GCF Chairman; and Mr Joseph Koh, Chairman of Friends of Bukit Timah Forest. It was a highly enriching experience for the LEEP team as they had an opportunity to showcase their work to the visitors that day.

#### December: Josephians Are Champions at 9th ASEAN National Quiz

The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) organised the National- and Regional-levels of the 9th ASEAN Quiz, a biennial competition where youths can gain a deeper appreciation of the region’s political, economic, cultural and social developments. 15 Year 5 Josephians formed five teams of three members to participate in this year's quiz.  

  

The National-level Quiz attracted over 400 participants from 41 schools in Singapore. Adopting an online quiz format, the competition on 5 September challenged the participants’ understanding of ASEAN. The competition saw one of SJI's five teams emerging victorious in a close fight, and the winning trio of the National ASEAN Quiz -&nbsp;**Abdul Mateen**&nbsp;(ML514),&nbsp;**Jaedon See**&nbsp;(ML515),&nbsp;**Clarence Soo**&nbsp;(LE506) - had the honour of representing Singapore in the Regional round in mid-December.

  

The Regional-level Quiz in December saw representatives from the various ASEAN nations coming together to compete for the grand prize of USD1,500. Our Team Josephian emerged as 1st runner-ups in the Regional ASEAN Quiz after losing out narrowly to the Indonesian team.

  

Congratulations to all participating students who participated in the National ASEAN Quiz:

#### October: End-of-Year Thanksgiving Celebration

The Thanksgiving Assembly on 23 October officially marks the end of the school year. It began with a Mass where Catholic students and staff prayed in thanksgiving to God. This was live-streamed from the Chapel to various locations within SJI.

  

During the reflection exercise conducted in the classrooms, students penned their gratitude and reflections for the year onto paper which was then folded into origami. These were then strung together as a contribution from each class to be hung on the Gratitude Tree in the Chapel.

  

In his Thanksgiving Address, Fr Adrian reminded the school of the importance of giving thanks, especially in this difficult year. God has faithfully kept everyone safe and ensured we finished the school year well in spite of the many challenges. He invited all to especially give thanks for our efforts to keep our school community going and flourishing. He singled out the Executive and Administration staff for their quiet and generous service to ensure we were able to function as a school.

  

At the assembly, the school also thanked and bade farewell to the staff who are leaving and retiring, with words that celebrated their contributions and a token of appreciation.

#### October: Year 4 IP Paraliturgy &amp; Farewell Ceremony

The Year 4 IP Paraliturgy &amp; Farewell Ceremony was held on 22 October to mark the boys’ transition to the next phase of their Integrated Programme (IP) - the 2-year International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) from 2021 to 2022.

  

The paraliturgy and farewell event was a rite of passage for the IP boys to bring to a close their secondary years, and to be orientated for junior college education. In a blink of an eye, the Year 4 IP cohort has completed their 4 years of Secondary studies. This event provided the boys with an appropriate time to pause and reflect on their experience. They were invited to cherish the different groups of people who had journeyed with them, lifted them up when they are down, and encouraged them by their positive influence.

  

Due to safe distancing measures, parents and guardians were unable to physically attend the event. Instead, they were able to watch the event live via Zoom broadcast. The Parent Support Group (PSG) recorded a specially made video to offer words of encouragement and well-wishes to the boys. The teachers who taught them in Lower Secondary also came together to cheer for them via Zoom.

  

Their Year 4 Form Tutors who have watched them grow into fine gentlemen throughout their Year 3 and 4 also went on stage to share their words of encouragement and support. They also shared their wonderful experiences in teaching and guiding these students.

  

There were also sharings by student representatives from each class, led by Head Prefect, Brandan Nicholas Bolte (MN401). They also shared words of affirmation for their peers. The current Year 6 students and alumni also were present to give valuable advice on how the boys could better manage their time &amp; the workload so as to meet the requirements and expectations of the IB curriculum and how they can make their IBDP experience in their Year 5 &amp; 6 more enriching and meaningful.

  

The ceremony ended with a prize award presentation by Brother President, Bro Paul Ho to the following Lasallian Distinguished Service Awards 2020:  
1\. Colin Toh Sze Peng (ML402)  
2\. Koon Wei Pheng (ML402)  
3\. Tan Wei Shynn (ML402)  
4\. Tan Ying Liang Torance (ML402)

#### October: SJI Graduates the Class of 2020

SJI celebrated the graduation of both Year 4 OP and Year 6 IBDP cohorts from the Class of 2020 on 2 October. This day marked the official end of their educational journey with SJI.

  

The graduation ceremonies were conducted from several locations due to safe distancing measures. While parents and guests were not permitted in school to participate in the grandeur of this event this year, they were invited to join in the event via a live-streaming.

  

Teachers presented the graduating Year 4s with collar pin each while every graduating Year 6 received a scarf. These simple gifts symbolized not just their graduation but the school's challenge for them to go forth and make a difference in the world by living lives of service for all.

#### October: SJI Teacher Receives Inspiring Teacher of English Award 2020

Congratulations to Mr Karthickeyen Govindaraj, who was awarded the Inspiring Teacher of English Award (ITEA) for 2020! He is one of the five teacher awardees who received the award via an online ceremony on 27 Oct.

  

The ITEA is a national award for English teachers in Singapore schools that acknowledges teachers who ignite a love for the English language and are effective in helping their students speak and write accurately.

  

In his congratulatory message for the 2020 Inspiring Teacher of English Award, Education Minister Mr Lawrence Wong shared how he enjoyed his English Language classes as a student but did not realize the importance of English for effective communication and the power of words to impact people until he started working. Words, he said, have the power to inspire and uplift people. They also matter because they can change the course of history, as well as build empathy, trust and understanding among the community. All this is possible is because of the important role English Language teachers play in teaching students to communicate well, use language responsibly, and connect with others. These teachers are passionate and innovative in their teaching. They always strive to foster in their students a love for the language. These year's ITEA awardees exhibit these traits, he noted. Read his&nbsp;[full speech here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/speeches/congratulatory-message-by-mr-lawrence-wong--minister-for-education--for-the-2020-inspiring-teacher-of-english-award).

  

Here's what motivates Karthick as an English teacher:

#### October: Josephians Excel at the Commonwealth Essay Competition 2020

Among the 13,000 entries from across the Commonwealth were those from SJI. Our Josephians shared their views on the topic of ‘Climate action and the Commonwealth’. Their views were described as insightful, creative and beautifully written. Our young writers wrote passionately about environmental issues and the collective actions of individuals to create positive changes across the Commonwealth. Indeed, the words of EL Doctorow ‘Writing is an exploration. You start from nothing and learn as you go’ should continue to inspire our young to explore, innovate and write to make a difference in the world.

  

We are proud that our young writers have gone from strength to strength, with the number of winners surging from 43 in 2019 to 81 in 2020! Congratulations to all – 18 Gold, 21 Silver and 42 Bronze recipients!

#### September: Debaters Spar at SJI's Inter-School Debate II

Students from St. Joseph's Institution and River Valley High School (RVHS) participated in SJI's Inter-School Debate II. This was an impromptu debate and debaters from both schools argued for and against the following motion -- 'This House believes that the feminist movement should support the narrative that "beauty does not matter" over the narrative that "all bodies are beautiful"

  

SJI was represented by debaters from both the Foundation Programme Academy and the IB Programme Academy. Our debaters argued well and were commended for their abilities. Like in the first inter-school debate between SJI and CHIJ in 2019, this inter-school debate has allowed SJI students to interact and reach out to students from RVHS.

As part of our school motto to reach out to the last, the lost and the least, staff of SJI embarked on our annual corporate social responsibility initiative in hope of rendering help to the community at large, especially during this difficult time. This year, SJI continued the partnership with our adopted beneficiary organisation -&nbsp;[Food From The Heart](https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg/)&nbsp;(FTTH). During the month-long collection drive, our staff were encouraged to donate food items such as Milo, biscuits, sardines and baked beans. It was heartening to see our staff give back to the community by contributing in the little ways that they can. The donation drive was concluded by end September and representatives from FTTH collected the donated items from the school.

#### August: Gems of OMG Challenge 2020

A group of Year 1 and 2 Josephians pitted against one another in the 'One Minute Gem' (OMG) Challenge held at the PAC. The boys spoke with enthusiasm, confidence, and a high standard of English on a topic given to them just 10 minutes before they took to the stage. Even though they are very talented in their own ways, it was tough to speak for a minute (almost impromptu) in front of an audience as well as to the audience in the classroom yet these students did it with candour.

  

The OMG Challenge was helmed by Jasper Davis Slade Lim An, Gong Xin Huan, Nigel Rushton-Young, Ethan Koay, Kayden Ee, Gopikannan Nishesh, Alexander Pook, Fan Enrui, Koenig Nicholas Gerard, Chen Wei En James Ryan and Dinesh John Peeris who produced the promotional video, design of the badge, logistical support and hosted the event.

#### August: SJI Celebrates Poetry Potpourri

<img src="![](/images/Poem%20of%20the%20Day%2013-7-20.jpg)"  
style="width:70%">

Our English teachers together with Teacher-Librarian Mrs Boey put up&nbsp;**POETRY POTPOURR**I&nbsp;\- a week-long celebration of local and international poetry in July.  
  
Due to the current safe management measures, the Author Visits and mass gatherings could not be held in the Library. Instead, the competitions and activities were moved online:&nbsp;**[https://sites.google.com/sji.edu.sg/librarywebsite/events/poetry-potpourri](https://sites.google.com/sji.edu.sg/librarywebsite/events/poetry-potpourri)**&nbsp;(this site requires an SJI email login)  
  
Staff and students shared their favourite poems and poets during this time, and many also attempted to craft their own bouquets of poetry! Read about them via the&nbsp;**[Poetry Bouquet Display Board](https://padlet.com/Mrs_Boey/1dldfbu1hl962die)**.

#### August: Giving Life Through BLOODay

SJI successfully held its first BLOODay of 2020 on 12 August. 88 altruistic students and staff members who registered to donate blood saw a total of 63 bags of blood being collected.

  
<img src="![](/images/Blooday.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

This long-awaited BLOODay came after the cancellation of the first blood donation drive in April this year due to the Circuit Breaker. Although there was a need to adhere to the safety measures put in place, the SJI community still took the time to donate and rallied together to support a greater cause in a responsible manner. Even though some donors were turned away due to low haemoglobin levels or fine veins, everyone’s intention to donate displayed a readiness to help the last, the lost and the least. Their efforts responded to the dwindling blood bank as many Singaporeans were not able to donate blood during this pandemic time.

#### August: Reaching out in a Pen-demic

Josephians from selected Year 1 classes were involved in a writing initiative with their younger peers from Bendemeer Primary School (BPS). This Pen-Pal programme aims to promote social interaction of young people from different age groups, develop positive attitudes towards writing and for students to experience the joys of writing and receiving a physical letter.

  

<table style="margin: auto; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; clear: both; border: 1px solid transparent; table-layout: fixed;" class="ive_eobj_center ives_tab_kosong"><tbody style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><tr style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><td style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 15px 15px 0px; vertical-align: top; width: 384.961px;"><img style="margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px; border: none;" width="100%" src="![](/images/Enjoying%20the%20experience.jpeg)"></td><td style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 15px 15px 0px; vertical-align: top; width: 290.312px;"><img style="margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px; border: none;" width="100%" src="![](/images/Signed%20and%20sealed.jpeg)"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<img src="![](/images/Excited%20to%20send%20off%20their%20letters.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">

Over a period of 6 months from March to August, there were 4 exchanges of letters – 2 from SJI and 2 from BPS, where our Josephians would initiate to share their thoughts about secondary school life, their interests/hobbies as well as experiences about the HBL. In turn, the BPS students would reply in kind. The students from both schools gained an authentic writing experience which allows them to communicate with confidence and empathy, as well as develop a greater sense of social responsibility and cultural awareness.

  

The joy in learning is echoed by the students who participated in the programme:

  

“_I never thought I would receive a letter from a pen pal. Receiving her reply was thrilling. I felt pleased that my ideas and opinions were accepted. We communicated quite well because we share common interests in food and hobbies and the love of Maths. I realised my pen-pal is a young Malay girl and through our letters, I learnt more about cultural sensitivity. My interest in writing has improved and I no longer show reluctance when asked to write. This assignment has taught me to be more appreciative of others. It has made me realise that we live in a global village and most of us share the same needs and concerns regardless of age and culture. I hope I’m a better person!_" –&nbsp;**Dayal Nitai Rauinderan**, SJI  

  

“_Writing pen pal letters is a truly refreshing take on the learning of the English Language as we were provided with the opportunity to converse with a Primary 5 junior in a new manner. My pen pal and l had a delightful conversation, albeit spread across several months. From this task, l have learnt how to write a meaningful letter and l look forward to more activities like this._” –&nbsp;**Samuel Lim**, SJI

  

“_The Pen Pal Programme has been an amazing experience for my friends and me. It helps to improve our writing skills and we learnt a variety of vocabulary words and sentence structures. It also makes learning more meaningful as we learn to write a letter to a real audience. It is also exciting to receive letters from older students who gave us advice for our studies, on managing stress and preparing for the transition to secondary school life_.” –&nbsp;**Pearlyn Kaur**, Bendemeer Primary School

  

“_The COVID-19 pandemic did not dampen our spirits. In fact, through the letters, I learnt about how my older pen pal coped with Home-based Learning during the Circuit Breaker period. Furthermore, interacting with someone whom I have never seen or spoken to before makes it a delightful experience for me. My pen pal is very friendly. He motivated me to study hard. I really wish to continue this programme because it was very fun reading and writing these letters. This experience was enjoyable and pleasant_.” –&nbsp;**Aaradhana Chandrasekaran**, Bendemeer Primary School

#### July: Cyberthon 2020 Competition

The second edition of ‘Cyberthon’, a cybersecurity competition for students studying in Junior Colleges and Centralised Institute organized by Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) was held on 2 May. Cyberthon aims to nurture young talents in cybersecurity and provide students with a glimpse of the important roles of a cybersecurity professional. Cyberthon consists of two components: a training session and a competition. This year, due to the evolving COVID-19 situation, both the training session and competition were held online. The Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT) conducted an online training session on 4 April for students who were introduced to basic cybersecurity and data science concepts. The students were then given an additional one-month online training where they could work on more cybersecurity and data science exercises to further hone their skills before the competition.

  

As part of the Coding and Technology CAS activities, eight Year 6 students (forming two teams) represented SJI in the Cyberthon competition. This competition is a blessing for our students as they had little experience and knowledge of cybersecurity. It was also a great opportunity to learn about the rapidly-developing field of computer science and security systems. Concepts like web exploration, penetration testing, reverse engineering and much more were taught, then tested in the intense 8-hour competition through real-life scenarios. Taking part in Cyberthon enlightened the students of the sheer utility and cruciality of skills and knowledge in programming and relevant technologies that drive the fundamentals of modern-day growth and development. The students received certificates of participation.

#### July: Blessing &amp; Opening of the new Labyrinth at SJI


The Labyrinth sits in between the Secondary Science Lab Block E and Block F. An initiative by the SJI Chaplaincy team, it was blessed and officially opened by Fr Adrian Danker on 16 July 2020, on the Feast of Mount Carmel.

<img src="![](/images/Labyrinth.jpeg)"  
style="width:70%">  

A labyrinth is a curving path. It is an ancient, sacred symbol found in many religious traditions. Christians in the Middle Ages saw the labyrinth as a symbolic pilgrimage. The labyrinth is basically a prayer space; a space where we enter to experience the presence of the divine, regardless of whatever life situations we are in.

  

The labyrinth is not a maze, because there is not a choice which way to turn. The path of the labyrinth will lead you to a center, and the way to exit the labyrinth is the same way as you enter. The center is where we meet the divine, who is always in the center of our lives.

  

Entering the labyrinth is to set ourselves apart to enter into a pilgrimage, a journey where the divine shows Himself to us in ways beyond our understanding. The labyrinth provides us with a space to slow down from our hectic lives, to take a slow walk, to reorientate, and to realign our compass in our lives.

  

The school plans to introduce students to the labyrinth as part of the Year 1 Josephian Formation Journey Programme. It will also be used for Level retreats and recollections.

  

Josephians are welcomed to spend time contemplating as they walk the labyrinth.

#### July: Josephians' Works Are Featured in Publications

Congratulations to our Josephians whose works have been featured in the following publications:

*   **Caleb Chan**&nbsp;(FN602) whose short story “Insomnia” was published in this year’s edition of ‘Eye on the World’. This book gathers the best writing of the students who have attended MOE’s Creative Arts Programme. Caleb participated in the CAP seminar in June 2019 and was then selected for the CAP mentorship programme. A copy of the ‘Eye on the World’ is available for reading in the Beurel. Synopsis of his story:  
    A man harbors an irrational fear that his son will be taken away by the darkness of nighttime. While he fights sleepiness to keep a vigil, he eventually succumbs to the fatigue and dozes off, only to have nightmares of a familiar, shadow-like figure swallowing his son whole. When he wakes up in tears, his son comforts him and day breaks.
*   The essays by&nbsp;**Daniel Hoh**&nbsp;(FN202) and&nbsp;**Edmund Wong**&nbsp;(LE303) were shortlisted and published by the New York Times. The theme of the 2019 New York Times Asia-Pacific Writing Competition was "Our World: 2050". Their works were selected from amongst over 1,200 entries received from 24 countries and regions.
*   **Miao Qiaozi**&nbsp;(FN402),&nbsp;**Uy Robert Frederik Diaz**&nbsp;(FN402) and&nbsp;**Yuan Chenghao**&nbsp;(ML403) who researched, authored and presented a paper on ‘Bimetallic Ammeter: A Novel Method of Current Measurement’ in the journal, Emergent Scientist.

Our Josephians from the Catholic societies lent their voices to this virtual combined choir video by De La Salle Schools worldwide. United as Lasallians, they sang the famous hymn - 'Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee', which was written by Henry Van Dyke and set to Ludwig van Beethoven's symphony number 9.

  

This hymn was chosen to thank the selfless sacrifice of medical personnel around the world. It is hoped that in times of despair during COVID-19, everyone around the world can remain joyful.

  

The choirs were from:

1.  Colegio La Salle Buenos Aires, Argentina
2.  De La Salle College Ashfield, Australia
3.  La Salle College, Mass Choir, Hong Kong
4.  La Salle Green Hills, Kundirana Music Ministry, the Philippines

May: Josephians Win Distinction and Merit Awards at 2020 International Mathematical Modelling Challenge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations to&nbsp;**Lin Sixun**&nbsp;(LE402),&nbsp;**Lee Rui Kai**&nbsp;(LE509),&nbsp;**Chen Dong Jun**&nbsp;(MN516),&nbsp;**Ramesh Babu Rohan Babu**&nbsp;(MN517),&nbsp;**Judah Lai**&nbsp;(FN302),&nbsp;**Nguyen Quang Minh**&nbsp;(LE403),&nbsp;**Edmund Tan Chun-Kiat**&nbsp;(LE403),&nbsp;**Axel Jude Chong He Jun**&nbsp;(MN516) on their excellent performance at this year's International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (IMMC)! They have shone by earning Distinction and Merit Awards as the two mixed-level teams from SJI!

  

As part of the competition, our 2 groups of students were required to work on a real-world problem and devise a Mathematical solution in a 20-page report during the school holidays in March. They were not allowed to seek any help from teacher advisors or any other "human" help and were only allowed to refer to online sources and books.

  

The IMMC is an annual international competition on mathematical modelling. It aims to promote the teaching of mathematical modelling and applications at all educational levels. It is based on the firm belief that students and teachers need to experience the power of mathematics to better understand, analyse and solve real-world problems outside of mathematics itself – and to do so in realistic contexts. IMMC (Singapore) is jointly organised by mathmodelling.sg and IMMC, in collaboration with the Academy of Singapore Teachers, National Junior College and Raffles Girls School.

April: Josephian Placed 15th in Singapore Skateboarding Championships
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations to&nbsp;**Cillian Lim Jin Han**&nbsp;(LE102) on being placed 15th in this competition. He pursued his passion with enthusiasm and determination. He competed with older and more experienced skateboarders and has done well!

  

As a “Sk8tr Boi” – also the title of his essay contribution – Cillian counts skate parks as his second home. “Sk8ter boi”, or more commonly known as “skater boy”, is street slang for a skateboarder.

  

He has been taking skateboarding lessons since he was seven. He said, “You get a certain satisfaction when you land a trick. After all the hard work, you feel like you’ve actually achieved something.”

  

His skill set includes ollies, which involves using his back foot to smack the tail of his board against the ground while his front foot pulls the board up into the air, and boardslides, which see him sliding the middle of his board across a rail or a ledge (pictured above).

  

He wrote about his skateboarding experiences in his essay last year when he was in Primary 6 at St Joseph’s Institution (SJI) Junior. He is now a Secondary 1 student at SJI. Said Cillian: “I want to give skateboarding more recognition... This could be my future.”

April: Josephians Embark on Green Lenten Project in 2020
--------------------------------------------------------

The SJI Lenten initiative this year created an opportunity to promote a greater awareness of the environmental needs, using the Pope’s encyclical, Laudato Si’ as its inspiration. The aim was to give the students an approach to Lent with a different perspective such as:

1.  fasting from unnecessary use of materials that are harmful to the environment.
2.  giving alms by recycling used products (that are still in good condition) to people who do not have the privilege of using them.
3.  and 'grounding' everything in prayer.

March: Josephian Educators Reflect Through Lasallian Conversations
------------------------------------------------------------------

In times like this with the COVID-19 outbreak, what holds a school together? A community that cares.

  

This was the focus of our Lasallian Conversations for Term 1 on 5 March. Each term, the staff gathers to reflect on our identity and mission as Lasallian educators. Through our conversations, we build on the values that distinguish us as a Lasallian fraternity of educators.

  

Today we reflected on St John Baptist de la Salle's call that teachers "must get to know their students and discern the manner in which to act towards them." In short, we reflected on how we teachers care in SJI. We did this by reflecting on how much and how intimately we know each student by class, level, academy and CCA/CAS. We also challenged ourselves to describe what we know about students as learners and persons.

  

We ended by recalling the story of the old man throwing starfish back into the sea. Our students are like starfish we must care for. We gave each teacher a card to identify students who they least know and want to care for by making a significant difference in their lives -- this year. Why? Because each one of them matters as a person. More significantly, we want our teachers' good work of preferentially caring for the least known to matter to others. We hope that others seeing how our teachers care, they will care too, as Alan Johnson eloquently said.

  

"It was a good morning spent amongst a fraternity that really cares to build the SJI community. Thank you, teachers, for reminding me about what matters in times like these. And thank you, Lasallian Conversations Committee, on a job well done today!", said Fr Adrian Danker, SJ.

February: Celebrating Ash Wednesday, the start of Lenten Season
---------------------------------------------------------------

"You cannot give what you don’t have." We’ve heard this phrase. This is why we educate Josephians to give what they receive in school, most of all the gift of themselves as God forms them to serve others.

  

Today we were blessed to celebrate Ash Wednesday in SJI and have the ashes sprinkled on our heads. We also heard God’s promise to restore us as his beloved even though we are sinful. The ashes remind us to repent and return to the Gospel life. This is Jesus’s life with God and all peoples.

  

We are called to live like Jesus and be His ambassadors to all, especially, the last, the lost and the least in today’s world.

  

This is why Josephians carried home ashes from SJI to their families and friends. To invite them to remember, celebrate and believe in God’s promised restoration as Lent begins in Singapore without Masses in churches because of the coronavirus.

  

Today Josephians gave what they received - more than ashes, God’s love for all peoples.

February: SJI Celebrates Inauguration 2020
------------------------------------------

SJI begins every new school year with an Inaugural Celebration. In light of the COVID-19 situation and the need to minimize co-mingling within the school community, Inauguration had to be celebrated with a different touch this year. We began with a mass for the Catholic community, where the school colours were also blessed.

  

The Inaugural Celebration was then broadcast live to all the classrooms from Missio 1852, our heritage gallery. Everyone prayed together, listened to the Inaugural Address, and recited the Teachers and Josephian Pledges. We closed with the singing of the School Rally and rang the old school bell to mark the new school year beginning!

  

In spite of the challenging landscape and various limitations, SJI began the 2020 school year by starting right, starting together and starting better this year!

February: SJI Welcomes Year 5 Freshmen at Orientation Week
----------------------------------------------------------

SJI welcomed the new batch of Year 5s with vigour and excitement on 5 February. Despite the evolving circumstances arising from COVID-19, the Orientation programme was swiftly modified by the organising committee that comprised the 7th Senior Student Council and their teachers Mr Wong Chee Choy and Mr Christopher Ngoh. They facilitated a smooth transition and immersion for the new students into the IB Diploma Programme.

  

The Year 6 OGLs and Student Council invested great effort to ensure that the freshmen enjoyed Orientation 2020 to the fullest. Several of the seniors from Year 6 prepared a heritage play for the newbies that reenacted the story of our Founder, De La Salle. This garnered a number of praises and positive response from the Year 5s as they had fun watching the play and learning about De La Salle's struggles in providing education to the poor. Through the Josephian Challenge, the Year 5s bonded with their friends in their Orientation groups through team games and had a chance to visit the heritage gallery, Missio 1852, to learn about SJI's rich history.

  

Orientation concluded with the Year 5s tying on their SJI ties and wearing their badges. The Principal, Fr Adrian, shared a reflection about the significance of wearing the SJI tie with the Year 5s.&nbsp;[**Read Fr Adrian Danker, SJ's reflection here**](https://sites.google.com/a/sji.edu.sg/sji-principal-speeches/reflection-for-year-5s).

January: Josephians Celebrate Lunar New Year
--------------------------------------------

The Lunar New Year or "spring festival" is a time to celebrate Togetherness with our families. This is what staff and students did as we welcomed the Year of the Rat.

  

The Chinese Language Department led a series of activities to celebrate the Lunar New Year. This included a workshop on couplets writing, an exhibition on the traditions of the Lunar New Year and CNY Classroom Decoration Competition. They also organised the sharing of the festive goodies amongst the staff.

  

Our celebrations of the Lunar New Year in SJI are like the 'springtime' buds beginning to blossom in school. Be it the bud of friendship and community, of learning and growing up, of teaching and becoming better, of care and support, of living together and sharing for all, there is something good waiting to burst forth into our lives and for our lives in the coming new lunar year.

January: SJI Welcomes Our New Year 1 Josephians
-----------------------------------------------

[![2020-01-17-Year 1 Orientation Camp](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49481721531_07b4495051_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/albums/72157712952016476 "2020-01-17-Year 1 Orientation Camp")  

The lighting of the fire over the Star at the Oval on 17 January is to symbolise the Josephian Spirit that burns in each and every Josephian from the day they join SJI. The evening of the Orientation Campfire was 'lit' with cheers and songs that were sung the way Josephians would sing.

  

Witnessing the Year 1s proudly singing the school songs and moving to action songs with enthusiasm was a delightful sight and memory for the Josephians, their parents, guests, and alumni who were present. With one voice, everyone sang in unison and with good cheer as one Lasallian, Josephian community.

  

The flame kindled in the hearts of the new Josephians and their parents. It was fanned into a great big flame by the school’s welcome. It will be sustained by the brotherhood our new Josephians now share.

  

This flame was lit in our Year 1s to burn in them as a light to guide their way ahead. More so, as light that transforms them to be a light for others through life’s journey. Finally, as the light that disperses the night and brightens each new day.

  

Welcome to SJI, Year 1s!

January: SJI Welcomes Australian Trainee Teachers as Part of Professional Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SJI believes in sharing the very best that makes us SJI. We call this aspiration 'sharing our SJI significance,' and we want to share not just within our shores but beyond our shores as well. This is why we welcomed 4 South Australian trainee-teachers – Claudia Richards, Daniel Massaci, Sarah Browning and Luke Wittenberg – who were attached to SJI from 7 to 24 January. Their attachment was under the auspices of the Australian Government New Colombo Mobility Plan which aims to increase Australian tertiary students' knowledge and relationships with the Asia-Pacific region. Trainee-teachers under this programme have the opportunity to learn about teaching through intercultural visits.

![USA-20200123-WA0011.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2020/USA-20200123-WA0011.jpg)  

These South Australian trainee-teachers were mentored by Mrs Pennie Ong (Innomaker + Art), Mr K. Arul (PE) and Mr Lee Han Seng, Mr Anthony Khoo and Ms Ong Mei Fen (Math). Under the guidance of these experienced teachers, the Australian trainee-teachers learned about our teachers' dedication to the profession and the rigour of the Singapore curriculum. As part of their learning journey, they were assigned to a Year 1 class and participated fully in the Orientation Programme. All of them remarked how the spirit of ‘brotherhood’ was palpably evident as it bonded the new Years 1 with the SJI Community so well and so quickly.

  

Besides observing their mentors, having conversations on pedagogies and curriculum and planning for their own lessons, the Australians also received feedback that helped them to improve their craft.

![USA-20200124-WA0019.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2020/USA-20200124-WA0019.jpg)  

‘Your school’s sense of community and core values have inspired us,’ they said, adding that they look forward to incorporating what they had learnt into their future practice.

January: SJI Releases 2019 International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme Examination Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Summary of 2019 International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) Examination Results:**

1. 99.64% of 280 IBDP students from our Class of 2019 cohort were awarded the International Baccalaureate Diploma, with an average score of 40 out of 45 points.

2. Two students were awarded the prestigious Bilingual Diploma.

3. 59% of the cohort (164 students) attained at least 40 points out of 45.

4. 19% (52 students) achieved 43 points and better.

  

The Class of 2019 includes 122 boys who were admitted to SJI at Secondary 1 in 2014 under the Integrated Programme. The results achieved by our Class of 2019 attests that the SJI IBDP relates well with students who enjoyed high academic expectations from the programme. They have found joy in learning by being risk-takers who pursue their interests and passion instead of being rote-learners.

  

The school is proud of the Class of 2019 for their determination, effort and great faith in overcoming many challenges to attain good results. More importantly, this Class exemplifies the very best of being a Josephian – they have studied hard, grown up well and contributed to make the school and world a better place.

  

As a Catholic and Lasallian school, SJI is committed to developing every student’s character and to helping them realize their academic potential, so that they become men and women whose education empowers them to make a positive difference in the world. The IBDP results of the 2019 cohort are an affirmation of the quality of the balanced and holistic education offered at SJI.

January: SJI Staff Go on Mystery Bus Tours
------------------------------------------

On 3 January, our SJI staff boarded six buses that took them to six undisclosed destinations. This was part of our fun-filled Staff Bonding Afternoon, an activity in the Annual Staff Conference to begin the new academic year. During the 3-hour long mystery journeys, our staff discovered new places and strengthened friendships with one another.

1\. The historic Former Ford Factory where the British forces surrendered unconditionally to the Imperial Japanese Army on 15 February 1942 was one of the six sites. Here, our staff gained fresh perspectives on the fall of Singapore through three intertwining narratives on Japanese aggression, British defences and how civilians in Singapore were caught up in the large forces of imperial struggle and war. It encouraged the teachers to embrace history and appreciate anecdotes shared by those who have experienced the tumultuous time. Many said they would not to take Singapore's success for granted. More importantly, they left understanding the importance of teaching our students about resilience and managing diversity and differences.

At the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) staff viewed the rich artistic heritage of Asia, especially the ancestral cultures of Singaporeans. ACM focuses on the many historical connections between the cultures of Asia, and between Asia and the world.

  

Staff also viewed a special exhibition, "Living with Ink: The Collection of Dr Tan Tsze Chor," that explores the passion and connoisseurship of Chinese art in the Singapore art world in the turbulent 20th century. The creative station allowed our staff to try their hands at designing and creating Chinese scrolls.

  

3\. Staff also visited FireFlies Health Farm. Through sight, smell, hearing and touch, our they were introduced to the basic knowledge of farming. They learned about the differences between organic farming and conventional farming.

4\. Gardens by the Bay. The staff stopped to smell the roses at the Flower Dome where they were surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colours. They were transported to a mystical land of mist at the Cloud Forest with its many plants of intricate designs. The beautiful greenery was both calming and rejuvenating. It was a wonderful afternoon of leisurely strolls, casual conversations and relaxation.

  

5\. The National Gallery. Here, the SJI teachers had the opportunity to have a ‘dialogue’ with Art. The artworks from across Southeast Asia allowed them to see the history and transition of the art scene Southeast Asia, giving us an insight into their lives, traditions and culture. The Kepple Centre for Art education not only provided an exciting line-up of programmes for youth, children and families. It gave the teachers the opportunity to have hands-on experience with creating art. It was an enjoyable afternoon to be immersed in art, to learn art, appreciate art and even create art - together!

6\. Jewel Changi Airport (JCA). The teachers were thrilled that they were heading to one of Singapore’s latest iconic attractions! Upon reaching JCA, they gleefully explore the Canopy Park, where they enjoyed the creative and dazzling displays of flowers. A few adventurous teachers tested the giant slides within the park while the savvy shoppers later satisfied their retail fix with a plethora of shopping options. What better to bond than through food as they ventured to engage in hearty conversations over shared root beer floats, curly fries and other delectable delights.

  

All in all, the Mystery Bus Tours was an opportunity to rekindle old relationships and establish new ones. This staff bonding activity is certainly one that we will remember for a long time!

January: SJI Staff Resume For New Academic Year
-----------------------------------------------

![20200102_115744.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2020/20200102_115744.jpg)

All SJI staff were welcomed back to school on 2 and 3 January to prepare and plan for the new academic year. We also welcomed new staff who joined the school. At this annual Staff Conference, the school leaders and academic heads discussed the school's 2020 Work Plan that focussed on developing the Josephian to share the SJI significance. Staff were introduced to Josephian Formation Journey, a new programme by the Student Development Team. This aims to develop our students' character and citizenship for them to become persons of integrity and persons for others.
