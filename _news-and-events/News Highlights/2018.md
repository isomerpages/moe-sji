#### December: SJI Remembers Mr James Tseng, Founder of SJI Pelandok 2104 Scout Troop

<img src="![](/images/Pelandok%20-%20Portrait.png)"  
style="width:60%">

The SJI family is saddened at the passing of Mr Tseng Yan Lin James, founder of the SJI Pelandok 2104 Scout Troop. He passed away peacefully on 9 December 2018, at the age of 91. Fondly known as “Pelandok” to his scouters with whom he has shared decades of his passion in scouting, Mr Tseng was part of the La Salle family for most of his life.

  

An old boy of SJI from Standard 1 when the Primary and Secondary Schools were co-located, his studies were abruptly halted when the Japanese occupied Singapore in 1941. He was only 15 years old and worked for 3 years with a Japanese trading firm and a telecommunications company to survive.

  

When the war ended, Mr Tseng went back to school in SJI and graduated with a Final School certificate at the age of 19. He went on to pursue a Teachers Training course whilst teaching in SJI and continued to teach in his alma mater for another 5 years.

  

He was offered an Education Ministry scholarship to study at the then Singapore University and graduated with a degree in Mathematics in 1960. He was posted to teach at various schools, including Swiss Cottage Secondary School, MacPherson Secondary School, Willow Avenue Secondary School and Pasir Panjang Secondary School.

  

He was eventually appointed Principal of Upper Serangoon Technical School and thereafter of Montfort Secondary School until his retirement in 1987.

  

Throughout his long and fulfilling career in education, Mr Tseng's selfless contributions to the Scout Movement have been instrumental in making scouting alive and well today. He was responsible for reviving the St Joseph's Pelandok 2104 Scout Group in 1950. Inspired by the philosophy of self-help, perseverance and resourcefulness, Mr Tseng decided to introduce scouting as part of an extra school curriculum. His passion in scouting eventually led to one of the Brothers, Brother Joseph Kiely, FSC, becoming interested in scouting as well.

  

Mr Tseng has been the driving force behind the many activities of the Group. These range from international events like the 17th World Jamboree in Korea and the visit of the King of Sweden to Singapore, to national events like Environment Conservation and his support of HQ and district activities to bring scouting to greater heights. After his retirement, he still actively serves the Group as Group Scout Leader, an appointment he has held since 1957. Under his capable leadership, the Group boasts of a long list of recipients of the District Commissioner Award, Chief Commissioner Award and President's Scout Award. On the 165th anniversary of the founding of SJI, the school honoured him to be the Guest of Honour at its Founder’s Day.

  

The Pelandok Scout Group, one of the few groups that has 3 sections registered, offers comprehensive programmes for youths between the age of 9 and 18 years from St Michael's School, SJI, Junior Colleges and the various Polytechnics. The Group organizes the Bi-Annual Round Island Canoeing Expedition and Mountaineering Climbing Expeditions to Mount Kinabalu on a regular basis.

#### November: SJI Admits Students Beyond Academic Talents

SJI is committed to developing every student beyond academic talents. We seek to also develop their non-academic talents. This commitment underlies SJI's approach towards the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise: Year 1 students can be admitted under the talent domains of innovation, leadership, visual art, music, and sports. This approach is aligned to the school's belief that every student brings a gift to school where it can be developed for the common good in society. It is also aligned with the school's mission to always look out for the last, the lost and the least.

  

Muhammad Daiyan Iskandar, 13, was admitted to SJI (via DSA Leadership domain) because of his leadership qualities. The former head prefect in Dazhong Primary said: "I like SJI because it's like a family, and it's not about exams and competitions."

#### October: Thanksgiving in Gratitude for 2018

As 2018 drew to a close, SJI remembered the events of a busy year at the Thanksgiving Assembly on 26th October. There was a great sense of pride and achievement as the processional contingent led the school colours into Founder’s Hall. The ceremony began with a rousing singing of the “125th Anniversary Song” before viewers were treated to a colourful yet disciplined spectacle of flags and banners from the uniformed groups, fraternity captains and student council presidents.

  

Friar Michael led the school prayer for the respective levels, with the theme of thanksgiving taken from Ecclesiastes. Each level was contemplative about a time for everything and to remind us to be mindful of “a season for everything under the heavens”.

  

The school also bade farewell to the staff who were leaving SJI. Most notably were the retiring of Ms. Teresa Lim and Ms. Khoo Cheng Eng, who have served the school for an impressive 27 years and 30 years respectively.

#### October: Men and Women for Others, Josephians for the Future

On an early Friday morning of 19 October, over 20 alumni turned up at SJI to speak to our Sec 3 and JC 1 students at the 8th annual Josephians-At-Large career workshop. These alumni who are mostly professionals in their own arena, presented on a wide variety of careers, to help the young Josephians learn and plan for their future careers. Since its inception, the feedback from students has always been positive and that they truly value the personal engagement during these sessions.

  

This theme for this year – “Men and Women for Others, Josephians for the Future” not only traces its roots from what the alumni have inculcated during their time in SJI but also their own personal experiences and positive contributions to society and the communities.

  

This year, the Sec 3s were arranged into three separate but sequential sessions on careers that they had pre-selected while the JC 1s gathered in the lecture theatre for a forum style Q&amp;A session with a panel of speakers.

#### October: IB Class of 2018 Sent off at Farewell Paraliturgy and Graduation

By Mr Raymond Karam (Head of Level 6, IBDP)

  

12 October 2018 was a day to remember for our graduating Year 6 students. It began with a Paraliturgy where the students reflected on their years in school and the future ahead. It marked the end of their schooling years and a new beginning that was to come for many: National Service for the boys and universities for the girls. Candles have always been used to symbolise taking their light into the future to brighten the world with the values that they have been blessed with at SJI.

  

Many of the students found this occasion very emotional, especially the boys who have been in SJI for the last 6 years. Many shed tears and expressed their appreciation of friendships that they have shared over their teenage years. They sang the traditional school songs with passion and gusto, and with arms on shoulders over one other, to symbolise the bond that all Josephians share.

  

Mr Karam reminded the graduands that words of wisdom can be found everywhere. He pointed out the importance of being “men and women for others”, acting as “men and women of integrity” and being “servant leaders”. He encouraged the students to think about these words of wisdom, and to enact these principles in their lives.

  

The graduating class was then joined by the Year 5 students in the final assembly, where Vedant Chauhan, president of the 5th Student Council addressed the assembly. This culminated in an emotional send-off of the Year 6s as the Year 5s sang “The Salute to the Alma Mater” in the background.

  

The Graduation Ceremony in the evening saw the families coming together to celebrate with the graduands. SJI was graduating its largest cohort of 271 students since the IB programme started in 2013. Ms Janet Ang Guat Har, Chairman of Caritas Singapore, was the guest of honour. Ms Ang’s inspiring speech presented to our graduating students how she balanced her work as a Chairman of Caritas Singapore with being the Managing Director of IBM Singapore as well as being a mother to four daughters. The speech by Principal Fr Adrian Danker was as meaningful to the students. His reference to Ed Sheeran’s songs and humming of the lyrics eventually got the students singing along too.

  

Although the presentation of the certificates to all 271 students took a long time, yet every student was cheered for and celebrated with throughout the ceremony. To end off the celebrations, the SJI boys were sent off in the same way they were welcomed at the start of Secondary 1, with the ringing of the school bell from the former SJI campus at Bras Basah Road.

  

The following students have achieved the highest awards and recognition from SJI:

**Spirit of SJI Award**&nbsp;(Principal’s Award) and&nbsp;**Lasallian Distinguished Leadership &amp; Service Award**:

*   Neil Bhargava  
    
*   Vedant Chauhan

  

**Lasallian Distinguished Leadership &amp; Service Awards**:

#### October: SJI Teacher Wins Inspiring Teacher of English Award

SJI congratulates our English teacher, Ms Mishaelle Chua, for being awarded the Inspiring Teacher of English Award for 2018. She is one 9 awardees this year.

  

Mishaelle embodies the best of what English teachers do: teach students about the truth and goodness of humankind and how they can express these to better the world.

  

In her speech, Ms Indranee Rajah, 2nd Minister of Education, the GOH, said that English and English Literature teachers do not teach a subject or a communication tool. They teach students to know what is the truth and what is good, and how to express these to better the world. Teachers have an important role to help their students grow and contribute through the teaching of English and Literature.

#### September: SJI Celebrates with Class of 2018 at 166th Speech and Graduation Day

By Ms Patsy Chua (Head of Level 4, OP)

  

It was a 'Triduum' celebration for our graduating Year 4 boys on 28 September. From the reflective Paraliturgy in the morning where the boys were led by Friar Michael - to be retrospective of their call to mission which started when they joined SJI. During the Paraliturgy, the boys reflected on how they could continue to stay grounded to what they are called to do and overcome their challenges as they surmount the mountains in their lives after they leave SJI. As we pinned the SJI collar badges on our Year 4 boys, we celebrated their graduation. It was a day of gladness, as we cement their memories of SJI before they embark on new journeys ahead to serve the different communities and be persons for others after graduation.

  

The Farewell Assembly saw a joyous school community come together to affirm the boys becoming men for others, and their juniors celebrated their seniors' giftedness and love for the people demonstrated through their acts of service and leadership to the school.

  

The highlight was the 166th Speech &amp; Graduation Ceremony in the evening where the boys’ families came to celebrate the gift of each boy that God has entrusted the school with. The Guest of Honour was Mr Joshua Soh (Class of 1986), Chief Operating Officer, Nogle Limited. Many were encouraged and stirred by the speeches from Fr Adrian and Mr Soh – that the boys have been blessed with the SJI education and they would share the legacy of SJI education with others after they leave the portals of SJI.

  

The Class of 2018 is best remembered for their love for the community, willingness to go the extra mile and most importantly a cohort that rose above mediocrity as persons for others.

  

The following students are the winners of the highest awards and recognition from SJI:

**Senior Josephian 2018**:  

*   Koh Boon Kiat (MN403)  
    

  

**Spirit of SJI Award**&nbsp;(Principal’s Award) and&nbsp;**Lasallian Distinguished Service Award**:

*   Gabriel Yeo Chong Jing (ML401)

They displayed talent, passion, skill and creativity in every music piece played and art work exhibited. It’s amazing to see how much they have developed as musicians and artists in these two years. Art students from various schools also visited the gallery in the span of two weeks to draw inspiration and learn more about the IB experience. The exhibition runs till 21 September in SJI.

#### August: SJI Holds Annual Economics Symposium

The Economics Symposium that took place on 14 August has been very successful in bringing together the industry specialists and over 165 students and teachers from other schools. Together with our very own SJI Economics Y5 students, more than 500 attendees with eager and curious minds listened attentively to the talks and contributed to the panel discussions with numerous well thought questions.

<img src="![](/images/P1070795.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

The topic of this year's Economic Symposium was "Economic Outlook: Challenges and Opportunities". This is a particularly relevant topic for anyone studying Economics and also an opportunity for students and teachers unfamiliar with the subject to be exposed to views and predictions of the Singaporean Economy from industry experts. We were lucky to have Mr Mark Tan (GIC), Mr Goh Mia Hock (PSA), Mr Song Sen Wun (CIMB Private Banking) and Mr Liew Yin Tze (MAS) as our guest speakers, who were able to share their views from their respective fields of expertise.

Write for Kindness is a national creative-writing competition organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) and supported by the All In! Young Writers Festival by the Singapore Book Council. It is a platform for secondary, junior college, centralised institute, madrasah and international school students to promote kindness to the younger audience by creating age-appropriate and culturally relevant children’s stories, through short stories, poetry and illustrations.

August: SJIOBA Organises Tour At SJI's Former Bras Basah Campus
---------------------------------------------------------------

The SJIOBA Tour@SAM on 17 and 18 August was initiated as part of the Singapore Bicentennial Project, which aims to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of modern Singapore, to be held in 2019. Being one of the earliest schools founded in Singapore since 1852, SJI’s heritage and legacy at its original campus along Bras Basah road contributed an important part of the nation’s history. Thus, the St Joseph's Institution Old Boys' Association (SJIOBA) organised the tour to welcome the alumni and the public to visit its iconic campus before it is closed for renovation and restoration works for the next three years.

More than 200 alumni and members of the public packed the storied halls, made new memories and took many photos.

July: SJI Brings Home the Ortega Cup
------------------------------------

By Kelvin Hoon (Class of 1998)  
  

Jointly organized between Old Rafflesians Association (ORA) and St. Joseph’s Institution Old Boys’ Association (SJIOBA), the 12th Ortega Cup between SJI and RI was held on 27 July 2018 at Raffles Institution. A traditional exchange of appreciation plaques between ORA and SJIOBA marks the start of a wonderful day of great camaraderie and rekindling of old friendships.

  

The young Under-16 boys kicked off proceedings of the day with their youthful zeal and energy. Two successive quick-fire goals by our outstanding boys silenced the home crowd; only to be revived when the RI boys snatched back a goal just before half time - a screamer from outside the penalty box; drawing applause from all. Another quick attack right off the whistle restored SJI’s advantage of 2 goals ahead once more and it was followed with end-to-end action, including nerve wrecking misses by the boys to extend the lead. Our boys was clearly the better side, showing great skills and strength across all departments and with no surprise, won the game at 1-3.

![SJI U-16s.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/SJI%20U-16s.JPG)  

Literally translated from a famous Chinese proverb: “Old ginger is hotter than young ones”, our Over-40s gents came on the field and showed everyone what they were made of. With silk runs, great positional play and one-touch passing, our old boys featuring the likes of an ex-National soccer player and former SJIOBA president Kok Fann – played with grace and finesse over their tougher tackling RI counterparts. Some proved to defy age; rolling back the years and running like how they did when back in SJI. Both sides fought tooth and nail, leaving their sweat and blood on the field and cancelled each other throughout the games. There were moments of individual brilliance and tactical discipline but all was for nought and the game ended with a 0-0 draw. SJI, as the visiting team, wins this game.

![O-40s.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/O-40s.JPG)  

Sitting comfortably and winning already 2 out of 3 games against our Rafflesian counterparts, Siong Guan – an alumnus of 2003 and long-serving captain of our Under-40s team in his opening pep talk, asked for the team to not let up but to give their opponents a good match. The boys attacked at RI’s goal with vigour and purpose but were indecisive and RI finished as the better team at the end of first half with 0-0. Plenty of chances from both sides ensued in the second half but none were able to capitalize. Both teams drew at 0-0 at the end of full time. And again, SJI as the visiting team wins this game.

![U-40s.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/U-40s.JPG)  

With the completion of the 3 games, SJI was clearly the eventual winner of the 12th edition of the Ortega Cup and retained the trophy for the 3rd successive year. The boys were awesome and wore their hearts on their sleeves. We hope to continue this rich tradition in the years to come and continue to support our boys and girls in other similar soccer competitions.

  

An inaugural appreciation dinner/whisky event was also held on 21 August 2018 at a whisky bar to celebrate our outstanding win at the Ortega Cup 2018 and to thank everyone who has fought hard for SJI in the Ortega Cup games throughout the years.

July: Founder's Day Dinner
--------------------------

The SJI Old Boys’ Association reunited with the seven Lasallian schools in Singapore at the Founder’s Day Dinner on 28 July 2018. Held at the Pan Pacific Hotel, the theme for this year’s dinner was ‘Seven Lasallian Schools - One Family’.

  

The Founder Day's Dinner is a celebration of our Lasallian education, values and heritage, to rekindle the spirit and glory of the days of the old CBS Founder’s Day Dinners when all Lasallian schools came together to celebrate their common foundation.

  

In all, the evening brought together 350 alumni, teachers, school staff, students and family members from all 7 Lasallian schools - De La Salle School, St. Anthony’s Primary School, St. Joseph’s Junior (former St. Michael’s School), St. Stephen’s School, SJI, SJI International and St. Patrick’s School as well as volunteers from the Lasallian Youth Network.

  

Dinner was piped in by the SJI Pipe Band, SJI Student Council members performed with our Old Boy Busking Team and ran a photo booth featuring backgrounds from both SJI campuses at Bras Basah Road and Malcolm Road. A rambunctious fine whiskey auction conducted by emcees Anthony Lim and Cary Chan from the SJIOBA Executive Committee was the highlight of the night, raising spirits and laughter from their memorable high jinks.

  

The night ended with the School Rally, a song shared by all the seven schools. A moving show of unity as well as diversity as everyone sang with pride whilst naming their own school during the song.

July: Josephians Celebrate Racial Harmony Day
---------------------------------------------

SJI celebrated Racial Harmony Day on 20 July. This year’s Racial Harmony Day was particularly meaningful as both the Secondary and Senior Student Councils joined forces to put up some activities for the student cohort. Josephians were treated to a Lunchtime Jam organised by Rock-A-Cause, as well as appetizing traditional delights put together by our canteen vendors. The celebrations ended off with a bang where representatives from each class in the senior section donned their traditional costumes and sashayed down a Model runway with cultural music accompaniment.

This year, we strive to renew the Josephian Spirit in each and every Josephian, bringing together our SJI family and imbibing in them a sense of community as we witness the handover of leadership from the outgoing student leaders to the incoming student leaders. The investiture also reflects our gratitude to the outgoing 5th Student Council and CAS Leaders for their passion and dedication over the past year. In line with the council’s mission and vision, we aim to be the spark, to inspire both the council and the SJI community through our actions, as an embodiment of what it means to be a Josephian.

April: Josephians Receive&nbsp;Young Defence Scientist Programme (YDSP) Scholarships and Awards
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Young Defence Scientist Programme (YDSP) is a prestigious programme by Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and DSO National Laboratories (DSO). It seeks to inspire youth in the area of defence science and technology.

  

This year, 8 Josephians received YDSP Awards for Academic Excellence in Maths and Physics. YDSP awarded 2 Josephians with scholarships. Two more Josephians participated in the YDSP Research project. One of them is Ryan Karthik Pary who is featured below.

Mentors: Head Capability Development Charles Ng (pictured, left), Senior Principal Engineer Anthony Chua and Senior Engineer Raven Poh from Defence Science and Technology Agency's (DSTA) Command, Control and Communications Development Programme Centre

  

Is there a way for ground vehicles to automatically detect and overcome obstacles? This was what SJI student Ryan Karthik Pary (centre) and Raffles Girls' School student Avellin Wong (right) tried to tackle in their project.

  

The two 17-year-olds integrated ultrasonic and infrared sensors into their robot and programmed it to perform positive (above the floor surface) and negative (below the floor surface) obstacle avoidance along its path. They also added a processing interface which used information from the sensors to instruct the robot on where it should move forward to.

  

"I found the YDSP programme to be enriching – it’s beyond the classroom experience," said Ryan, who hopes to become a defence scientist.

  

Mr Ng, who was one of the team’s mentors, said: "I hope to spark their interest in science and technology as this is an area that is developing very fast. As Singapore is a small nation, I hope to be able to do my part in building up a force of local engineers, especially in the defence industry."

April: Mahalo: An SJI Carnival
------------------------------

By Koh Boon Kiat (MN403)

  

To celebrate the gift of thanksgiving and mark the return of SJI to her Malcolm Road campus, the 7th Secondary Student Council organised a school carnival on 14 April. Mahalo, which means gratitude in Hawaiian, captures the essence of the message the Student Council wanted to put across, as there is so much to be grateful for in SJI. Thus, in the spirit of thanksgiving, the proceeds of the carnival would be donated to Hopehouse and the school’s Student Development Fund.

![Students Painting the Banners &amp; Posters.png](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/Students%20Painting%20the%20Banners%20&amp;%20Posters.png)  

The days leading up to the carnival were tiring yet rewarding. From painting banners to counting tickets and designing merchandise, many volunteers from Year 4 and 5 offered to stay past their school hours to ensure the success of the carnival. The Parent Support Group (PSG) spent several afternoons with the student council to work out the various aspects of their stalls and were generous in their sponsorship of food and lucky draw prizes. With the help of students, teachers and parent volunteers alike, the carnival was poised to be a great success.

![20180414_150842.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/20180414_150842.jpg)  

On 14 April, the school opened its gates to a large eager crowd, comprising of friends, family and alumni, who could not wait to join in the fun and games. The live concert put up by talented Josephians, the trike-drifting event (pictured below) brought in by the SJI Old Boys’ Association (SJIOBA), and many more highlights, definitely brought the hype at the carnival to the next level. The highlight of the carnival was the opportunity to dunk our Principal, supported by the unanimous cheering of the excited spectators, heard above the fanfare.

![20180414_160240.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/20180414_160240.jpg)  

The 7th Student Council and Carnival Organising Team 2018, is extremely grateful to all teachers, students, parents and alumni volunteers for their effort, time and energy to plan and run the stalls. From designing the most artistic posters to coming up with an interesting game to entice the crowds, the carnival was a success and raised to a total of $30,000.

It was an amazing experience and we are extremely humbled to have an opportunity to plan such a large-scale event. We hope that it was a memorable and enjoyable event for all and we thank you for your support of Mahalo 2018!

April: SJI BLOODay
------------------

![BLOODay1.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/BLOODay1.jpg)

SJI held its first blood drive for 2018 at the foyer on 10 April. There was an overwhelming number of responses from the students, teachers and staff, totalling 100 sign ups.

![BLOODay2a.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/BLOODay2a.jpg)  

77 donors registered on the day itself. However, due to the stringent criteria required of all blood donors, only 55 people were eligible for blood donation. This amounted to almost 80% of&nbsp;the projected collection. The BLOODay CAS is very heartened by the enthusiastic response from Josephians for such an altruistic cause, living true to our mission of becoming “men and women for others”. The next blood donation drive will be held on 29 August 2018.

April: SJI’s Uniformed Groups March on at the Anniversary Parade
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Anniversary Parade (AP) marks the change of command of the school’s uniformed groups (UG) -- the NCC Land, NCC Air, NPCC, Scouts, and St John Brigade. For many of the Year 4 UG students, the AP is often known as the last parade, where they march for the last time with their respective units in SJI, before they step down to focus on their upcoming examinations.

  

The AP was preceded by skillful aeromodelling display by the NCC Air cadets and impressive precision drills by the NCC Land cadets. The SJI Bagpipes &amp; Drums and Military Band provided the music.

  

The Guest of Honour was Colonel Tan Boon Kiat, Joseph (Class of 1989). He is the Director, Nexus, Ministry of Defence. In 1989, Col Tan was part of the NCC Land Unit that took part in the Opening of SJI’s Malcolm Road campus by Dr Tony Tan who was the Education Minister then.

April: Founder’s Day
--------------------

St John Baptist De La Salle, the Founder of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, passed away on 7 April 1719. Every year, the school comes together to celebrate Founder’s Day in honour of St John Baptist de La Salle on a Friday closest to 7 April.

  

This year’s Founder's Day Assembly marked SJI's 30 years as an Independent School at our Malcolm Road campus. Mr Nicholas Fang (Class of 1991) was the Guest of Honour. He was amongst the pioneer batch of students to study at the then-brand-new Malcolm Road campus in 1988. He urged Josephians to be more than “cool Joes”; he challenged them to be “great Joes” in all that they do and become. At the celebrations, awards were presented to the top students who have achieved outstanding results in 2017. The school also thanked the Campus Development Committee that oversaw the redevelopment of the Malcolm Road campus. The celebrations began with Mass for Catholic students and teachers. The non-Catholics in SJI reflected on the values Bro Kevin Byrne lived his life by when he was Principal of SJI in 1988.

March: Easter Triduum Celebrations in SJI
-----------------------------------------

By Gatongay Ryqx Manoza and Manuel Tristan Pereira (FN302)  

Holy Week marks the most important season in the Catholic liturgical calendar. It begins with Palm Sunday and culminates in the Paschal Triduum (Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter Sunday).

  

On Maundy Thursday students and teachers witnessed the washing of feet. This was done by various teachers and students who were accompanied by their parents. The act of foot-washing reminds us of Jesus’ humility and His commandment to serve and love one another.

  

The Eucharistic celebration to recall Our Lord Jesus’s Last Supper with his disciples was held in the evening in the Chapel. It was attended by more than 300 staff, students and parents.

  

On the same night, the Catholic CCA groups went on their annual visitations to churches across Singapore. Some went on public transport while some went on foot from church to church. They recited prayers along the way as they recalled Jesus’ final hours before His crucifixion.

  

On Good Friday morning, the Stations of the Cross began at 3am and different representatives from different Legion praesidia led the groups in the Way of The Cross. A reflective mood was set with the repetition of antiphons, readings, and various re-enactments of certain scenes during the Stations. These helped the students to relate the story of each station to their daily lives. They also had hands-on activities where everyone wrote their sufferings on a cross made of ice cream sticks and exchanged it with someone else. The students then had a group sharing about the church visitation and their experience of the walk to the various churches. They were given a bun to break and to share it with everyone. A Good Friday service was held in the Chapel to conclude the activities for the Easter Triduum.

March: Josephians Relay in Support of Singapore Cancer Society
--------------------------------------------------------------

by Basil Tan (TG504)  
![Before the relay.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/Before%20the%20relay.jpg)  

The Relay for Life event organised by the Singapore Cancer Society on 10 - 11 March was an excellent opportunity for Year 5 students to get together and give back to society in a unique way. Almost one-third of the Year 5 cohort - a total of 65 students - participated in this event. The overnight relay saw 51 of us taking up the 100 km challenge as a team to complete the distance within 15 hours. The others just participated in the relay by walking or running. By simply having any one team member running at any time, we were able to show our support for cancer research and stand in solidarity with current cancer patients. As it was a team event, we had the chance to display teamwork by rostering and assigning different people to run at different points of time. Together, we were able to overcome the seemingly impossible task of running 100 km in about 10 hours, a surprising amount of time considering how demoralised we all were at the beginning.

  
![Relay For Life.jpg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/Relay%20For%20Life.jpg)  

Besides the main event, we helped to raise money for cancer research by blowing balloons. We also had the opportunity to meet cancer survivors who inspired us to continue running through the night and into the wee hours of the morning. Overall, it was a fulfilling experience for everyone and it was heartening to see people from all walks of life coming together to support a good cause.

March: Lasallian Catholic Youth Societies Camp 2018
---------------------------------------------------

The Catholic Camp on 9 March began with an opening address by Mr Dominic Ang (Vice-principal, Student Development), where he called everyone to silence, to remind everyone about the peaceful tranquil sound of silence. Opening songs led by the Praise and Worship team set the mood for the camp - one that was upbeat and energy-filled. The Year 1 students, along with their respective facilitators were at various locations around the school campus for games and other bonding activities.

![IMG_8873.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/IMG_8873.JPG)  

After an hour of games, everyone was hungry and settled in at the canteen to prepare for dinner. The fellowship meal began with prayer and songs. One could feel the energy flowing through the air as everyone sang ‘Hinei Ma Tov’ loudly and proudly with the strong steady beat of claps and stomping of feet. Incorporated into the meal was the aspect of being in a faith community, where the importance of helping each other was stressed upon. This was followed by the movie ‘Pursuit of Happiness’. It was screened in the Lecture Theatre. This was followed by Night Conversation where the groups went for a late night reflection. It was heartwarming to see the Year 1 students open up and share their thoughts with their group members. The praise and worship team wrapped up the day with one last hymn for the night, “Thankful for this good day”.

![IMG_8941.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/IMG_8941.JPG)  

The second day started with breakfast and morning prayer. The Presidents of the 3 presidiums - Jon Kwong, Gabriel Yeo and Matthew Notorahardjo - explained the meaning of Monday, Tuesday and Thursday’s psalms from morning prayer. Our lunch sustained our energy for the next praise and worship session. The songs were beautifully led by the Praise and Worship team made up of Year 5 and 6 students. Mass was then celebrated by Friar Michael D’Cruz, OFM. The camp came to a close with us remembering and thanking God for a good weekend spent with friends in reflection, prayer and song.

The quartet of Br. Emmanuel Gerardo Sia, Ms Thea Quintos, Ms Vangie de Peralta and Mr Jayjay Jacinto arrived from the Philippines to conduct 2018’s Lasallian Formation Day in SJI’s founders’ Hall and library on 9 March. Our fellow educators from St. Patrick’s School joined SJI Teachers for this morning’s reflection of what Lasallian education is all about.

![Ms Vangie de Peralta in action.JPG](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/Ms%20Vangie%20de%20Peralta%20in%20action.JPG)  

Teachers reflected on and shared their responses to such questions as “Who was that teacher who asked you the right question and why?” or “How would I describe the current Lasallian youth of today?” Brother Manni also contextualized some of his teaching experiences in Luzon and provided tips on cultivating a better “student-centered relationship”. The session concluded with Fr. Adrian Danker (Principal, SJI) summarising the morning with A.C.T, an acronym that stands for:

  

A. – Ask students the right questions to set them on the right call or direction.

  

C. – Care for them by nurturing significant relationships with regard to their studies and growth.

  

T. – Teach them to learn and live with what matters - the more significant things like Faith, Community and Service.

The Athletics Cross-Country Team participated in the Wings Cross-Country event on 24 February. The SJI crossers did well and our 'C' Boys achieved a 3rd Team overall position. Mohammad Shaariq Anshad (ML201) came in 2nd and Ku Zi Ming (LE202) came in 9th. What was more surprising was our new Year 1 boy, Kieran Andre Longue (ML102) was placed in the top 20 at the 19th position. His training from the beginning of the year paid off handsomely. Even though our 'B' Boys are not in the medals position, the team led by captains Tang Kai Evans (ML403) and Avdhoot Fuke (LE401) performed well and all of them finished the race close to each other.

For the third year running, the SJIOBA organized the ‘What it means to be a Josephian’ talk for our newly enrolled Secondary One boys on 22 Feb 2018. The one-hour interactive session between the alumni and the students excited the students as they learned about the rich heritage of SJI and how to become exemplary Josephians. Many look forward to the formative years that they will spend in SJI and becoming Men for Others.

-----------------------------------------

By Ms Tay Tze Hoon  

The Chinese New Year celebrations began with "珲春” (Hui Chun) - a calligraphy activity held at the Foyer on 14 Feb. Students and teachers seized the opportunity to try their hand at writing auspicious Chinese calligraphy phrases. They also admired the beautiful calligraphy works by Mr Ron Tok, Mr Tan Puay Hock &amp; Ms Huang Mei.

  

Celebrations on the eve of CNY on 15 February began with a Mass in Lecture Theatres 2 and 3 and a reflection activity in classrooms. This was followed by a CNY concert in the Indoor Sports Hall. Ang pows were presented to the school’s support staff and the cleaners in appreciation of their hard work. An exciting performance by professional dancers from The Dance Ensemble was the highlight of the CNY celebrations. The elegant dances and the splendid performance of martial arts wowed the audience and drew rounds of applause as the event came to a close.

February: Josephians United at Inaugural Assembly
-------------------------------------------------

By Adam Christopher Yamson Chan (LE401)  

Josephians came together as one community for the first time in 2018 at the Inaugural Assembly on 9 February. This was the first official assembly to welcome all students, including the Year 1 and 5 students who had just completed their week-long orientation camps and been introduced to the SJI community.

  

The 2018 Prefectorial Board, the two Student Councils and various student leaders were also officially appointed at this Assembly. The Lasallian Awards were also given out to the deserving recipients.

  

The SJI Vocal Ensemble showcased its veritable repertoire of songs, from school songs like “Hymn to St. Joseph” and traditional and familiar Catholic compositions such as “O God Beyond All Praising”, to more unconventional songs of worship like “O Sifuni Mungu”. The ensemble did not fail to bring out both the spirit of SJI and the artistry of music to enrich the 2018 Inaugural Celebrations.

  

The Inaugural celebrations concluded with an outdoor movie screening on the school field, where Josephians came with baskets of food and drinks to picnic under the stars with their fellow classmates.

February: SJI Welcomes the Year 5 at Orientation Camp Olympia
-------------------------------------------------------------

By Maretta Simon (TG606)

Orientation Camp (OC) “Olympia 2018” was the pinnacle of many Josephians’ IB experience in SJI, and indeed it was a blast for the new Year 5s. Looking at the new faces trying to make small talk, enjoying themselves at the beach, shouting their hearts out for their Fraternities was rewarding to all of the Orientation Group Leaders. Not only was it the start of something new for the Year 5s, it was also a reflective time for the Year 6s as we embrace the final lap of our journey here in SJI by stepping up and taking on the role to be the seniors in school.

  

As many watched that last fireball goes down the string during Campfire, our hearts melted in an amalgam of joy, happiness and fear of what is to come next. This marked the start of an even tougher road ahead, but even so, we were grateful for everything that has happened, and for everything that is yet to come. The magic of the community touched our hearts and pushed us to go the extra mile during the intense one-week camp, but it was all worth it. Orientation was one tiring journey filled with many skype calls, editing proposals after proposals, rewording safety measures, and many others, but OC 2018 brought up the best in Josephians: the spirit, the care, the love for one another. Ora et Labora!

January: Once In a Blue Moon
----------------------------

![supermoon3.png](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2018/supermoon3.png)  

On the eve of 31 January, the Astronomy Club organised a night of moon viewing during an extremely rare celestial event. The super blue blood moon, estimated to occur only once every 150 years, was out in full view that night. The celestial show is the result of the Earth, Moon and Sun, lining up perfectly for a lunar eclipse as the Moon is at its closest point to the earth, making it super large. The eclipse began at roughly 8.00pm, as a black shadow began to devour one corner of the moon. Within minutes, the lunar surface began to plunge into darkness or totality, after which the bronze rusty tone began to sheath the moon reflecting the light of all the sunrises and sunsets on Earth at the same moment. Along with more than 40 students and staff who attended the viewing, the Astronomy club had a great time learning about the night sky through powerful telescopes, while admiring the wonders of the blood moon in the company of friends and music.

The Astronomy club would like to thank Joachim Ong, one of our old boys who came back to share some of his telescopic equipment with us.

**Seven students achieved perfect scores of 45 points**, and&nbsp;**17 students had a near perfect score of 44 points**.&nbsp;**50% of the cohort (69 students) scored 42 points or more**, and&nbsp;**79% (109 students) attained at least 40 points out of 45**.&nbsp;**Six**&nbsp;students were also awarded the prestigious&nbsp;**Bilingual Diploma**&nbsp;this year.

  

The Class of 2017 includes our pioneer batch of 55 boys who switched from SJI’s ‘O’-Level Programme to the Integrated Programme at Secondary 3 in 2014 to do the IBDP. The results achieved by our Class of 2017 is evident of a trend that the SJI IBDP relates well with students who enjoyed high academic expectations from the programme. They have found joy in learning by being risk-takers who pursue their interests and passion instead of being rote-learners.

  

Fr (Dr) Adrian Danker, SJ, Principal of SJI, says “_We are very proud of our fourth IBDP cohort who have graduated with stunning results. More importantly, we are glad to know that our students have enjoyed learning from the two-year IBDP. We are confident that they are well prepared for their next phase of education beyond SJI. But what I am particularly proud of our school's achievement is that our students achieved this by having a healthy and happy balance between studies and play, between learning deeply and serving the community generously, between acquiring skills to do well in the world and letting our Lasallian values and ethos form them into men and women who now want to go out and make a difference in our world. To see this alive in our students is for me the enduring gift they have received from an SJI education that I know they will share with many_.”

  

As a Catholic and Lasallian school, SJI is committed to developing every student’s character and to helping them realize their academic potential so that they become men and women whose education empowers them to make a positive difference in the world. The IBDP results of the 2017 cohort are an affirmation of the quality of the balanced and holistic education offered at SJI.
