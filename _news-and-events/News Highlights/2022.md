#### December: SJI Remembers Former Alumnus - Fr Gerald Tseng

<img src="![](/images/JA1982-FrTsengLOM-QOAS.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

SJI is saddened at the passing of Fr Gerald Tseng, an alumnus and a Jesuit priest. Fr Gerald studied at SJI for most of his early school life except during WWII. The La Salle brothers who taught at SJI had a profound influence on Fr Gerald and he aspired to be a teacher like them, dedicating his life to moulding young boys to be men for the future. He wanted to be a priest as well as a teacher and therefore chose to be a Jesuit. After receiving his Senior Cambridge certificate at SJI at the age of 21 in 1950, he left Singapore to join the Jesuit Novitiate in The Philippines.

  

After his ordination in 1963, Father Gerald was posted to Kowloon to teach before transferring to St Francis Xavier Church in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia for eight years. He finally returned to Singapore in 1976 to teach at his alma mater, SJI while playing the role of chaplain at the Catholic Junior College hostel.

  

Fr Gerald's quiet spirituality touched many throughout his journey as a priest and teacher, and his ex-students speak fondly of him as one of the nicest teachers at SJI. “Father Tseng taught me Science and he was very kind. He would tell us to mark topics in order of 1st importance, 2nd importance and 3rd importance, Basically, if you studied only the 1st importance topics, you would be all set,” reminisced Matt Lee, an old boy of SJI who was taught by Father Gerald in the 1980s.

  

“O God, by whose favour your servant, Fr Gerald, was called to the religious life and who witnessed to the message of salvation by his dedication to Christian faith and education, grant that he may be admitted to your eternal friendship with those who have likewise zealously laboured in Your Vineyard. We ask this through Christ, our Lord. Amen.”

#### December: SJI Remembers Former Staff -Miss Balkis Bee

The SJI family extends its deepest condolences to the family of Miss Balkis Bee, our former Executive Secretary to several SJI Principals. Miss Bee joined SJI as a Clerical Assistant in Sep 1971 and served the school and the La Salle Brothers religiously from the Bras Basah to the Malcolm Road campuses. She proved to be an industrious and devoted staff and eventually rose through the ranks to become Executive Secretary to the Principals. In her distinguished career spanning 48 years at SJI before she retired officially in Dec 2019, she had served 7 Principals - the late Bro Patrick Loh, the late Bro Joseph Kiely, the late Bro Kevin Byrne, Bro Paul Rogers, Mr Lui Seng Cheong, Dr Koh Thiam Seng and Fr (Dr) Adrian Danker, SJ.

  

Miss Bee was also a recipient of several national accolades and awards, including the National Day Awards for Efficiency (1997) and Long Service (1999), a Diploma of Benefaction awarded by the De La Salle Brothers (2002) and the Outstanding Contribution Award-Team Award (2012).

  

After her retirement, Miss Bee returned to SJI on 1 Jan 2020 to work as an HR Officer on a part-time basis until her contract ended on 31 March 2021.

  

Miss Bee truly embodied many of the Lasallian virtues like generosity, piety, humility, patience and wisdom. The SJI family has lost a true Lasallian.

  

Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and may perpetual light shine upon her.

#### Partnerships with SJI Parent Support Group

The SJI Parent Support Group (PSG) has been an important partnership between the parents and the school. SJI is grateful to our parent-volunteers and the PSG EXCO who organized many activities in 2022:

  

*   **SJI Parents Rosary Chat Group**

Initiated by the PSG 4 years ago, our Catholic parents have faithful praying for the school community once a month. The group comprises parents whose children are at different levels and some of them still join in even though their children have graduated from SJI. The rosary devotion is usually held on the morning of every 3rd Friday of each month via zoom.

  

*   **Parent Volunteers in the Library**

Since July, our parent-volunteers have covered about 300 library books to make them more durable and extending their shelf life. They also taught interested students how to crochet in the De-stress Corner and prepared materials for Christmas craft (planned post-exam activity)

  

*   **Supporting students for Night Study Programme**

Many parents lent their support to provide a variety of food choices for the two Night Study Programmes in Terms 3 and 4. The PSG also planned a pizza party for the boys to celebrate during the last day of Night Study in Term 3.

#### November: Year 5 Josephians Win Two International Science Awards

25 Year 5 students mentored by five teachers participated in the "Global Scientist Award" as part of their virtual Global Experience Programme (GEP) with Ikeda High School (Kagoshima, Japan) that began in mid-August and ended with a final Zoom session on 15 November. The annual international competition hosted by Ikeda High School is backed by the Japanese education ministry and several research companies and Universities, including pharmaceutical giant Otsuka Pharmaceuticals and Chiba Institute of Technology. For the 5th year, the event this year involved a total of 68 teams of students from China, Finland, Japan and Singapore, across 3 categories: elementary school, junior high school and high school.

  

Two of the five SJI teams who participated in the high school category received awards. HE7 was one of the seven out of 55 high school teams that received the Outstanding Award while HE9 was awarded the Favourite Presentation by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals.

  

Outstanding Award (Team HE7):

*   **Lim Yee Kiat Zachary**&nbsp;(LE510)
*   **Ong Li Ern Alicia**&nbsp;(LE510)
*   **Vincentius Markandeya Santosa**&nbsp;(LE510)
*   **Zhang Weihang**&nbsp;(LE510)
*   Teacher Advisor: Dr Sergei Prokopenko

  

**Research Topic: NEWater Characteristic Analysis**

The team presented their study, which aims to test a selected number of these parameters (both chemical and physical) to verify the safety and cleanliness of NEWater in Singapore. Their findings found that NEWater is both safe and clean for consumption despite the controversy of reclaiming used water. Their study contributed to the scientific basis supporting the process as a sustainable solution to the water issue, and the presentation received many positive comments and compliments from the judges.

  

Water is an essential resource for the function and survival of natural and socioeconomic systems. Despite this, over 1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, a shortage which is expected to grow with the rising threat of global warming. Thus, there is a constant need to advance our technology to keep up with the growing demand for clean water. In Singapore, an innovative approach to the water issue is ‘NEWater’, a form of reclaimed water in which wastewater is treated and turned into high-purity clean water. This process employs three main technological operations: microfiltration, reverse osmosis and UV disinfection, all of which contribute to the removal of impurities, bacteria and viruses. NEWater has repeatedly met the clean drinking water standards set by the World Health Organisation.

  

Favourite Presentation (Team HE9):

*   **Andrew Tay Bin Song**&nbsp;(ML512)
*   **Audrey Yeo Min Hui**&nbsp;(ML512)
*   **Balaji Prakash Narayanan**&nbsp;(ML512)
*   **Chuah Jiao Yao**&nbsp;(ML512)
*   Teacher Advisor: Mr Raymond Wong

  

**Research Topic: Calcium demineralisation of Toothpaste** <br>
The team investigated the effectiveness of protection of the toothpaste of different brands that are widely used in Singapore and/or Japan. The experiment is carried out by coating 6 samples of bones with various brands of toothpaste for 24 hours, then drying and crushing to increase surface area. A bone without toothpaste is included as a control. The judges were impressed by the fact that the team compared toothpaste available in Japan and Singapore.

  

Hydroxyapatite Ca10 (PO4) 6 (OH) 2 makes up 70% to 80% of our enamel and dentin by weight, and this hard covering protects the teeth. Below the critical pH value (5.5), the calcium and phosphate ions in hydroxyapatite dissolve out of the enamel and react with the H+ ions derived from the acids present. This process is known as demineralisation. The pH of the oral environment drops due to an increase in presence of an acid, which occurs due to a plethora of reasons: (1) Sugar consumed reacts with bacteria to produce acid due to anaerobic conditions, (2) Consumption of food and drinks with acidic content. Common acid found in food is citric acid, and (3) The stomach’s contents, including hydrochloric acid, will flow back up into the oesophagus and enter backflow into the mouth during acid reflux, which occurs when the lower oesophagal sphincter muscle relaxes after a meal instead of closing tightly. Toothpaste contains fluoride compounds which allow for the remineralisation of the enamel.

#### November: Josephians Go Global with GEP

Once again, SJI hosted Cura ("Cura" means "to care" in Latin) - a virtual international student exchange, as part of its Global Education Programme. This year, SJI was joined by our partner schools from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines:

*   Suncheon Jeil High School, South Korea
*   Gyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages, South Korea
*   La Salle College, Hong Kong
*   Salesian Of Don Bosco Ng Siu Mui, Hong Kong
*   Wah Yan College, Hong Kong
*   Seifu Nankai Jr. &amp; Sr. High School, Japan
*   Sakura High School, Japan
*   Saint Jaime Hilario School - De La Salle Bataan, Philippines
*   De La Salle University Integrated School, Philippines
*   St Joseph School - La Salle (Bacolod), Philippines

Cura 2022 focused on three United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), "Good Health and Well Being" (UNSDG #3), "Responsible Consumption and Production" (UNSDG #12) and "Climate Action" (UNSDG #13). These spurred the participants to think deeper about how they can contribute towards building a better society for all.

  

Over the course of three weeks, participants gained greater perspectives about these UNSDGs, from the Opening Ceremony's Keynote Speaker, Ms Emi Kaneko, Director of Japan Science and Technology Agency (Singapore Office), and from the various correspondences with the partner schools. The students also learned more about their new friends from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines - about their culture, education, hobbies and the societal and environmental issues that they are facing. It was an enriching journey for all the participants who are blessed to have made new friends and deepened their understanding of the world through these online meetings.

#### November: Understanding Global Issues through Ergo

![IMG_4339.jpeg](https://www.sji.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/News%20and%20Events/News%20Highlights/2022/IMG_4339.jpeg)

Weish, local musician and dynamo, speaks to our Y5 students

  

On 10 November 2022, teachers, Y5 students and visitors from SOTA came together to enjoy Ergo, SJI’s annual Global Issues Festival organized by the English (IBAM) Department. The name “Ergo” indicates the interconnections between ideas that undergird our understanding of situations and issues in our complex and volatile world. This year’s theme of identity was met with interest and curiosity. Students were rapt at local musician Weish’s intimate (and tuneful) sharing of her struggles with her identity as an individual and artist, participated in the lively workshops put on by our Language and Literature teachers and guest speakers, cheered on their friends during the engaging poetry recital by the Literary Society and shivered or laughed in the after-dark literary experience.

#### November: Josephians Showcase Enterprising Project at NXplorers

Congratulations to our young conservation warriors -&nbsp;**Ciaran Liam Condron**&nbsp;(LE301),&nbsp;**Premanandan Dishnu**&nbsp;(LE301),&nbsp;**Lee Jayden Seo Jin**&nbsp;(LE301),&nbsp;**Sidharth Subramanyam**&nbsp;(MN301) and&nbsp;**Nathaniel Cheng Le Shan**&nbsp;(ML302) who were mentored by SJI teacher Ms Gina Tan and Mr Ernest Lee from Shell - for their enterprising project on recycling orange peels at the NXplorers Project Showcase!

  

The NXplorers Journey 2022 was a year-long STEM-based programme organised by the Singapore Science Centre and Shell Singapore which aims at challenging schools to find innovative ways of solving problems related to food, water, and energy. Although daunting, SJI’s team SUS-tainability decided to take on the challenge, becoming one of the top 13 schools to receive a seed funding of $2,500 as well as the NXplorers trophy.

  

The team had set their sights on two key issues: a big amount of water usage and food wastage in Singapore. To combat them, the team had a secret weapon: orange peels. Using the bio-adsorbent properties of orange peels, toxic chemicals can be removed from the water, allowing more water to be reused in addition to giving food waste a second life. Under the guidance of their teacher-in-charge, Ms Gina Tan and mentor from Shell, Mr Ernest Lee, the team developed a modular prototype design to house the orange peels and other chemicals such as activated carbon. The orange peels were then placed in an aquarium and acted as an alternative natural organic filter to remove harmful aqueous ammonia in the water that might spike in level and kill the fishes. This method of water purification using orange peel is both safe and cost-effective.

  

Throughout the year-long journey, team SUS-tainability acquired useful skills, ranging from experimental techniques in the lab to effective communication. They also learned an important fact that no matter how small our effort may seem, we can make a big difference and produce a positive impact on our environment. This has encouraged them to be more sustainable and to inspire others to do the same, helping our community become more green and eco-friendly. Read more about their sustainable project:

#### August: Josephians Participate in Youth Engagement Session by PA MESRA

By Bilquis Aimie Binte Muhamed Abdillah (MN518)  

<img src="![](/images/MESRA.png)"  
style="width:60%">


The People’s Association Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (PA MESRA), together with Malay Language Committee, organised a youth engagement session for Pre-University Madrasah Malay/Muslim students on 20 August, for youths to network and share their aspirations and concerns, learn about the available resources from community partners.

  

The event was hosted by Madam Rahayu Mazham, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Law and Ministry of Health &amp; Adviser to PA MESRA Youth, who engaged in an insightful dialogue on key issues raised by students; most notably the controversy around DPM Heng Swee Keat’s comment on the possibility of a non-Chinese Prime Minister in Singapore, the extent of the effects of Malaysia’s Bumiputera law on the economic and education gap of Singapore’s Malay community in addition to the ambition of Malay youth and how it interplays with the expectation of success and wealth in the community. Besides discussing the extent of government assistance, Madam Rahayu reiterated the importance of self-initiative and gratitude.

  

The event also served as an opportunity for Malay students to be more aware of the available resources provided by Malay-oriented organisations such as Yayasan Mendaki and Club HEAL at various stages of their educational journey. The participants had the opportunity to discover and find more information about scholarship opportunities offered by universities such as NUS and SIT, as well as explore specific skills through fun activities such as candle-making and coaster-making.

  

The event was well-received by the eight Malay Language (MLB) students from SJI who found the experience enlightening and were more aware of the politics relevant to the community. One of the attendees, Adam Azlan from LE510, revealed, “The speakers were enthusiastic, and the MP answered all our inquiries with conviction, making us feel as though all our concerns were being heard. After the question and answer session, we had a lot of fun at the booths where we made our own candles and coasters. We also had the chance to explore and engage with representatives from different organisations that shared the many different pathways available after our graduation. All in all, it was an exciting, enriching experience.”

After a one-year hiatus, NSC is back! Four Year 3 students –&nbsp;**Ciaran Liam Condron**&nbsp;(LE301),&nbsp;**Lee Jayden Seojin**&nbsp;(LE301),&nbsp;**Aaron Wong Yi Cheng**&nbsp;(LE301) and&nbsp;**Nguyen Hoang Long**&nbsp;(LE302) – represented SJI to participate in the highly competitive televised National STEM Championship (NSC) 2022. Previously known as the National Science Challenge, the National STEM Championship adopts similar objectives and improves its relevance to better align with research, innovation and enterprise in the landscape of Singapore and the incorporation of the elements of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Started since 2002, the NSC provides Secondary 3 students with an opportunity to put their skills and knowledge to the test at on-site challenges hosted by A\*STAR research institutes and other research organisations.

  

Our boys went through many sessions of gruelling challenges, including a preliminary selection where 26 schools were selected to proceed to the quarter-finals. Out of the 26 quarter-finalists, SJI was one of the 12 schools that did well to proceed to the semi-finals. Although the boys have done very well throughout the competition, the team fell short of entering the finals as only one team in the group can make it to the Grand Finals of the NSC 2022. Do keep a lookout for the televised broadcast to watch our Josephians on their NSC journey on Mediacorp!

#### August: Commemorating National Day

<img src="![](/images/ND4Aug.gif)"  
style="width:60%">

This year, the National Day theme is 'Stronger Together, Majulah!'. This is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future. “Stronger Together” reminds Singaporeans that unity in our diversity is what makes us stronger. Communities, families and friends coming together form the bedrock of our nation’s strength and resilience, and enable us to overcome challenges. “Majulah”, which means “onward”, encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our independence 57 years ago, and is a rallying call for Singaporeans to strive for a better future, and grow from strength to strength as we emerge from COVID-19.

  

To commemorate National Day, SJI held a simplified National Day Observance Ceremony on 4 Aug, with a march-in of National Flag and School Flag by UG leaders, flag-raising ceremony with the singing of the National Anthem and recitation of the Pledge, and the Minister's National Day Message for Schools was read out by the President and Vice-President of Student Council.

  

On the eve of National Day, Josephians gathered to run together at the Annual Cross-Country Meet at Bedok Reservoir after a hiatus of two years. By running together, the SJI community continue to realise our dream of moving ahead together as SJI and challenges us to keep running forward together as one Singapore.

On 23 July, a team of St John Brigade cadets from Year 2 participated in the North District First Aid Competition. Organised by St John Singapore, this competition provides a platform for cadets to apply their First Aid and Foot Drill skills in a real world situation. Cadets are required to be extremely knowledgeable in both components to pit themselves against many top schools. This is no easy task and our cadets worked tirelessly for many months to adequately equip themselves for the rigour of the assessment.

  

The boys –&nbsp;**Alexander Chow Feng**&nbsp;(ML203),&nbsp;**Pirathap Cindmyan**&nbsp;(LE203),&nbsp;**Pradeep Kumar Aashish**&nbsp;(MN202),&nbsp;**Sundar Ashwin**&nbsp;(FN201) and&nbsp;**Wesley Chow**&nbsp;(MN201) – did extremely well to finish Second place in the District round, which led them to progress to the prestigious National First Aid Competition where they emerge Third place against top corps.

The spirit of arts came alive at the SJI Mutien Festival on 1 July! Organised in aid of Canossaville, SJI Mutien Festival 2022 was the largest scaled concert by SJI’s Performing Arts CCA groups – Bagpipes &amp; Drums, Band, Drama Club, Guitar Ensemble and Vocal Ensemble – since the pandemic started. It was a very special moment for many of the Performing Arts students as they shared their music, voices and acting before a large crowd of more than 500 family members, friends and teachers.

style="width:60%">

Patrons to the Mutien Festival were encouraged to donate generously to Canossaville, a Catholic social service agency that supports mainstream students, as well as those with hearing loss and/or multiple disabilities, giving priority to the poorest. The event raised a total of $7,860 (an increase from the initial target of $3,000) which will help the children and their families entrusted in Canossaville's care. As the donation received is part of Canossaville's Never Ending Gift 2022 campaign, it will be eligible for a dollar matching by the Government and Tote Board. This means the donations may be doubled to $15,720!

#### May: SJI Indian Cultural Society Organizes Tamil Language Camp

The SJI Indian Cultural Society (ICS) organized the Tamil Language Camp for the Year 1 to 6 students on 28 May. Mr Dominic Ang, Vice Principal of Student Development, lit an oil lamp to signify the start of the ICS Camp, which was followed by a speech by Mdm Selvarani, the ICS teacher-in-charge about the importance of Tamil Language and literature. S. Deenesh, President of ICS, welcomed the members to the camp that featured many enrichment activities on Indian culture such as the traditional music workshop where the students gained an understanding of the significance of Tamil music and tried their hands at numerous musical instruments. Students also had the opportunity to display their hidden acting talents and to master numerous facial expressions essential for drama at another workshop. Mr Arul, another SJI teacher, also conducted a “Bhangra” dance session which boosted the spirit of the camp.

<img src="![](/images/Tamil_language_camp_2022c.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">


Two notable alumni of ICS – Stalin Bill (Class of 2017) and Sanfo Bimal Thomas (IB Class of 2021) also shared their experiences with their juniors at this camp. Stalin gave a motivational speech about the struggles and challenges he faced as a student in SJI while Sanfo conducted a poetry workshop on the different ways of writing Tamil poems where he inspired many students to write Tamil poems. The camp also included an Amazing Race where the activities were aligned to the Tamil traditional culture such as Silambatam, a traditional combat sport.

<img src="![](/images/Tamil_language_camp_2022b.jpeg)"  
style="width:60%">

  

The ICS students reflected on the many new experiences and skills they gained from the camp:

  

*   **S. Deenesh**&nbsp;(LE402):&nbsp;_Being a part of this CCA made me realise how far I have grown from my cultural roots. In such a modernised world today, keeping in touch with our roots has never been more important. I took up the position of president in the ICS to better serve the Tamil students in SJI. My most fulfilling accomplishment would be the ICS camp that was conducted with my fellow Year 4 peers in the CCA for our juniors. The Indian Cultural Society was a beacon of joy and it was an honour for me to be a part of this CCA_.
*   **Felix Joseph Francis**&nbsp;(LE402):&nbsp;_My journey in ICS helped to develop my leadership ability and help my juniors learn more about their culture. ICS also served as an opportunity for me to know my roots and my heritage at a greater depth than before. The cultural aspects of our lives are often overlooked and left uncherished. The ICS guided me in rediscovering my identity and learning more about the Tamil culture along with my juniors who I helped along the journey_.
*   **Saravanan Balasubramanian**&nbsp;(ML101):&nbsp;_My favourite activity at the ICS camp was the poetry workshop by Sanfo. It was really interesting as we learnt about the different Tamil literary devices which I did not know about at all and we also learnt how they could be used for our Tamil literature. I plan to follow in Sanfo’s footsteps in his mastery of Tamil Literature and apply these skills in the future_.

#### April: Celebrating 170 years of Lasallian Heritage

[![2022-04-08-170th Founder's Day](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52010219049_831186e3aa_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stjosephsinstitution/albums/72177720298170983 "2022-04-08-170th Founder's Day")

The SJI community celebrated Founder's Day in honour of St.John Baptist De La Salle on 8 April 2022. Rallying as one community, Josephians recalled the zeal and perseverance of the first Brothers who arrived in Singapore and followed the example of St.John Baptist De La Salle to educate the young 170 years ago. At the same ceremony, we congratulated and celebrated the successes in studies and character achieved by our students over the past academic year.

  

To commemorate the school's 170th anniversary, two creative works by SJI alumni were officially launched - a new song titled "[**Green and White**](https://youtu.be/ZcgJeEbDQP0)" and two artworks from “[**A Walk in the Light of La Salle**](https://sites.google.com/sji.edu.sg/awalkinthelightoflasalle)” which were commissioned to highlight our Founder's formation journey. Mr Leo Yip from the Class of 1979, was our Guest of Honour who unveiled "Sharing the Light", the first of the two murals from the series of five works around the campus.

  

On the same evening, the SJI Uniformed Groups (UGs) commemorated the achievements of their Units and their Commanding Officers at the Anniversary Parade.

  

Guest of Honour Senior Minister Mr Teo Chee Hean (Class of 1972) spoke fondly about his schooling experiences at SJI, and the time he spent in NCC Land in&nbsp;[**his address**](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/SM-Teo-Chee-Hean-at-St-Josephs-Institution-170th-Anniversary-Parade). The event concluded with his unveiling of "Ignite", the second of the five artworks from “A Walk in the Light of La Salle”.

#### March: Lasallian Shares Insight on Future in Human-Machine Augmentation

Our University and Scholarship team held the 4th SJI Professional Speaker Series on 11 March that featured Mr Oliver Tian, who spoke on “Skills of the Future in Human-Machine Augmentation”. An alumnus of St Patrick's School, Mr Tian is an advisory consultant to both local and international startups and holds a number of concurrent pro bono appointments with non-profit organizations including Honorary Advisor, Asia Pacific Assistive Robotics Association; Vice-Chair, International Alliance of Robotic Associations; Vice-President, Global Robot Cluster and the Advisory Board Member (Responsible Technology Institute, University of Oxford).

  

The SJI Professional Speaker Series aims to expose our youths to renowned professionals who have not only made a mark in their respective professional fields but have also used their resources, skills and talent to add social and economic value to the community. As the salt and shakers in society, they are a force for good locally and overseas, hence worth emulating. Mr Tian is one of those successful technopreneurs who has successfully combined his advanced technology expertise with his keen entrepreneurial skill to devise innovations that create economic and social benefits for the end-users.

  

Mr Tian spoke on how humans can collaborate with machines to enhance human capabilities as well as the critical skills of the future needed to understand, explore and leverage technology to help increase human potential and benefit society. He provided the students with a foretaste of what the future marketplace will be like as companies adopt and integrate digital technology and end-to-end seamless artificial intelligence platforms into their operations such as the cognitive AI employee – "AMELIA", who is able to work continually 24/7 throughout the year. His advanced technological insights and wide experience enthralled his young audience, as evidenced by the active Q&amp;A session following his address.

style="width:60%">

About 50 Year 6 students attended the talk which was also live-streamed to all Year 5 and 6 students. Benjamin Wong (ML613) said, “This talk was one of the best I had participated in as it was very thought-provoking and it gave us a very insightful glimpse of the future”.

  

Indeed, Mr Tian’s parting exhortation to his SJI audience was to "Dream BIG, Think REAL and stay HUNGRY" to inspire them to stay relevant and nimble amidst rapidly evolving technological advancements, as our youths would be the next generation workforce to lead this human-machine augmentation.

#### March: Josephian Spars with Asian Fencers at Asian Junior and Cadet Fencing Championship

**Matthew Alexander Pang Rui-shen**&nbsp;(LE301) represented Singapore to fence against several experienced fencers from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Oman, Vietnam and India at the Asian Junior and Cadet Fencing Championship 2022 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan in February. Among the youngest in the competition, he was up against older competitors who were mostly 17 year olds who were much stronger, more aggressive and faster paced.

  

The AJCC Fencing Competition provided a really good learning experience for him to be better prepared for the upcoming World Junior and Cadet Championships in April where he will face stronger and fiercer opponents from around the world, not just from Asia.

Eternal rest, grant unto Mr Richard Magnus, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul rest in peace.

#### March: Let's Play Gamelan Together

Let's Play Gamelan Together on 7 March was the first in the series of activities for SJI staff planned by our Wellness Ambassadors - Mr Wong Chee Choy and Ms Daisy Chia. Our patient music teacher, Mr Samuel Ng taught us more than how to play the gamelan, the traditional ensemble music of the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese peoples of Indonesia, which is made up predominantly of percussive instruments. The most common instruments used are metallophones played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called kendhang or Kendang, which register the beat. Mr Ng also provided insight into the different types of instruments and their roles, and how when combined in playing produce a beautiful melody. Our staff attempted, fumbled and burst into laughter many times. It was a well-spent hour that brought both the academic and non-academic staff together and transported us to Java, even if it was just in our imagination.

#### March: Transit and Belong

Transit and Belong 2022 is a mental wellness programme in its fourth year facilitated by the CAS group YoungXHush. Held over four days in two weeks from 22 February to 4 March, these sessions aim to support the Year 1 students as they embark on a new school journey as secondary students in a new environment, from having to make new friends to coping with academic expectations. The senior students in Year 5 and 6 planned a variety of engaging activities such as learning Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) vocabulary, quizzes related to body language, and games regarding background differences. It is hoped the Year 1s will be able to appreciate how the people around them though different can still build a supportive learning environment together.

#### February: SJI celebrates 170th Inaugural Assembly

The Inaugural Assembly is the first formal school assembly of the new school year and is the culmination after a month of orientation for Years 1 and 5. It is a school tradition that formally marks the start of each new academic year when the entire Josephian community assemble in thanksgiving and prayer through the Eucharist, to celebrate our being as a Lasallian community. At this event, SJI officially welcomes the newest addition to the school – students (Year 1s and Year 5s) and members of the teaching and non-teaching staff.

  

This year, SJI celebrates 170 years of Lasallian mission in Singapore that began in 1852 when the first six La Salle Brothers arrived in Singapore on the ship “La Julie” at the invitation of Reverend Father Jean-Marie Beurel to provide for the educational needs of the poor in Singapore and Penang. These first six Brothers set up St Joseph’s Institution as a free school at Bras Basah Road that year. SJI became the first Catholic school and the third-oldest secondary school to be established in Singapore.

  

Just like Father Beurel and the first six La Salle Brothers who courageously boarded the ‘La Julie’ to embark on their mission to the Far East, Josephians too are called to embark together and by association, on a voyage of learning and adventure in the new academic year. The theme for the Inaugural this year - "Galvanising the SJI Significance", invites all Josephians to be curious and excited with the different gifts God has entrusted to us that we may use to help others. As Josephians "onboard" SJI in the new year, they will realise their own uniqueness and learn to appreciate others with different gifts. It is hoped that along the journey, they will use their gifts to care for one another, foster a sense of community as they bring out the best of themselves, to work together and by association, to galvanise our different strengths to promote the SJI significance.

  

SJI will continue to be "the ship" to navigate Josephians to be stewards with a purpose beyond themselves. The Stewardship Way of Life is the grateful response of a Christian disciple who recognises and receives God’s gifts and shares these gifts in love of God and neighbour. Students were invited to pen their unique gifts and a gift they hope to achieve in 2022 on a “sail-shaped” card, to remind them of their own ‘onboarding’ onto the ‘La Julie” ship (ie. SJI). These “sails” were collected from each class as a representation of the SJI community, and offered up at the Eucharistic Mass during the ceremony.

  

Students and staff also came together as a community to upcycle their old T-shirts to produce a DIY-Tote Bag. The completed tote bags that are presented to the community signify and remind us of SJI’s missionary history and tradition of our service to the community. Tote bags that are exchanged among our peers exemplify how we are gifts for one another.

  

At the same event, the SJI Student Council launched an initiative named “17,000 Good Deeds”. This initiative aims to provide an opportunity for the school to collectively do 17,000 good deeds to serve the less fortunate and to give back to the community, empowering our youths to become Men and Women for Others. These good deeds can be as simple as helping someone with their studies or lending a helping hand to someone in need done by all students and staff. Since its initiation, 360 good deeds have been performed to date (as of 28 February 2022). This project will officially close at Thanksgiving Assembly on 28 October 2022.

#### February: SJI Welcomes Year 5 at Orientation

The SJI spirit is one that is unique and empowering; it is one that is salient and an integral aspect of every Josephian. As such Orientation Camp (OC) 2022 aims to initiate and welcome the incoming Year 5 students into their IB journey with a sense of spirit and camaraderie, curating a sense of place and belonging within every Josephian. With the OC 2022 themed “Encender” (Spanish word for “ignite”), the organizing committee in Year 6 aimed to create a lively, welcoming and conducive atmosphere where new friendships will be made through all the camp games and activities, igniting the flame within Josephians not just at the beginning, but throughout their IB journey. This flame that is lit will bond our juniors together and maintain the faith that they have in one another. It is hoped that this will enable them to work together and fight in the face of challenges and difficulties, so that they will burn brighter and stronger as a whole community.

#### January: Josephians Participate in International Science Youth Forum

Rahul Singaram Senthilkumar, Fan Enrui and Chung Dohyun (all from FN402) participated in the International Science Youth Forum, a science enrichment programme for top research students where they can engage in projects and discussions with other top science students and renowned researchers from around the world.  

A highlight of their time at the ISYF was the Team Project Challenge, which involves a role-play scenario of a fictitious island nation plagued by a variety of natural and man-made disasters. The assigned goal of the students was to work in teams to tackle the issues with innovative solutions found through scientific research and 3D modelling. While the task was challenging, the teams found great pleasure in bonding with each other during their task. The Project Exhibition was another segment where they shared and exchanged knowledge about various science projects with peers from other countries, and the SJI trio was eager to present their project on extracting DNA.

#### January: SJI Hosts CURATE Inter-School Art Exhibition

[**CURATE**](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/curate2021)&nbsp;is an inaugural Art programme initiated by three schools - Fairfield Methodist School Secondary, Nan Hua High School, and St. Joseph’s Institution. With the support from National Arts Council’s Artist-in-Schools scheme programme, CURATE hopes to connect passionate students with a keen interest in the Arts to nurture the joy of art-making and broaden students’ perspectives of various art forms.

  

In CURATE 2021, 30 art students underwent a series of sessions, from artist workshops to a two-day Bootcamp Challenge and judging presentation. 15 students were then selected by our Artist Mentors – Ripple Root, André Wee, and Mike HJ Chang – to receive personalized tutorial sessions. The selected student artists were guided by our curatorial mentor, Michael Lee, to put up the show on their own.

  

Through this experience, with blended learning, students' understanding and appreciation of art in its various forms are deepened, particularly since the students obtained a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be mentored by professional artists and curator and be engaged in the Arts.

  

From 19 - 25 Jan, SJI hosted the exhibition titled ‘Impacting Changes’ at the Bunker. As society moves at its fastest pace yet, the exhibit was to reflect on issues that youths face today. Students drew inspirations from personal narratives and observations of the world and responded to the theme of ‘Curate’ – which originates from the Latin word cura, meaning care – by focusing on society, culture and the self. Through a variety of mediums – painting, sculpture, installation, and digital art – the passionate student artists provided viewers the time and space to slow down to make sense of the current situation, be it the pandemic, the changing culture, or personal sentiments.

#### January: Josephians Win Bronze Award at Yellowren Arts Festival

Four Josephians from the Josephian Arts Programme -&nbsp;**Kristian Ong**&nbsp;(FN201),&nbsp;**Marcus Ee**&nbsp;(FN303),&nbsp;**Keagan Goh**&nbsp;(MN403) and&nbsp;**Lin Jiekang**&nbsp;(MN402/2021), emerged as winners in the 2021 Yellowren Arts Festival Canvas Painting Competition, where they won a Team Bronze Award. Organized by Yellowren Productions, a leader in community arts based in Singapore and Japan, the theme for the festival in 2021 was “Redemption: Environment | Technology | Society”.

  

Our SJI students wrote: "We used the metaphor of natural resources and environmental destruction and the subsequent healing of that environment to show the redemption of society. As the earth's natural resources are burnt and smoke is produced, that smoke becomes water, which in turn gives life back to the earth. This shows that even though the earth's inhabitants are threatened every moment, there is still hope for redemption and there are still changes that can be made to take the advancements that have been used to destroy the earth and repurpose them to breathe life into a Redemption Tree."

January: SJI Releases 2021 International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme Examination Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SJI congratulates our Class of 2021 for their outstanding results achieved at the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) November 2021 Examinations.&nbsp;**All 269 IBDP students passed and were awarded the International Baccalaureate Diploma, with an average score of 42.2 out of 45 points.**

  

| IBDP Results by SJI Class of: | 2021 |
| --- | --- |
| Number of students | 269 |
| Diploma pass rate (%) | 100% |
| Average points out of maximum 45 points | 42.2 |
| Number of students with 40 or more points | 234 |
| Percentage of students with 40 or more points | 87% |

The Class of 2021 includes 119 boys who were admitted to SJI at Secondary 1 in 2016 under the 6-year Integrated Programme that leads to the IBDP in years 5 and 6. The results achieved by our Class of 2021 is evident of a trend that the SJI IBDP relates well with students who enjoyed high academic expectations from the programme. They have found joy in learning by being risk-takers who pursue their interests and passion instead of being rote-learners. This cohort was admitted into SJI IBDP shortly after COVID-19 measures began in January 2020 where they had to adapt to a compromised college life due to the pandemic and the constantly evolving Safe Management Measures that saw them having to adapt to learning online and having limited physical activities and interactions with their schoolmates.

  

Mr Justin Arul Pierre, Principal of SJI, says “_The Class of 2021 has demonstrated how resilience, determination, effort and great faith in their ability to overcome challenges can produce good results, despite the various disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have witnessed the hard work put in by the students from this cohort, many of whom have attained exceptional results despite their heavy commitments in various national competitions and student leadership responsibilities. They have exemplified the very best of being a Josephian – by staying the course with faith to keep learning, through service to help each other through the examinations, and as one community to look forward with hope. I also wish to thank all our teachers for their dedication, hard work and selfless efforts in guiding our students. The excellent results testify to the work of our competent and caring educators who are always prepared to go the extra mile and they have done all this in the face of the more demanding circumstances of this pandemic time. Truly, these Josephians are an exceptional class: they're a fine balance of grit and compassion. We are immensely proud of their achievements and wish them the very best as they move on to seek their passion in their future endeavours._”

  

As a Catholic and Lasallian school, SJI is committed to developing every student’s character and to helping them realize their academic potential so that they become men and women whose education empowers them to make a positive difference in the world. The IBDP results of the 2021 cohort are an affirmation of the quality of the balanced and holistic education offered at SJI.
