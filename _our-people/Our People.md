SJI is currently headed by **Mr Justin Arul Pierre**. Taking care of the learning needs of more than 2,000 students in SJI are 175 teaching staff comprising Heads of Department, Heads of Level and teachers and allied educators. The students and teachers are assisted by 41 administrative and support staff.

  

Our teachers are, in true Lasallian tradition, big brothers and sisters to the boys under their charge. The strong pastoral care in SJI is manifested in our teachers who strongly believe in and live out the spiritual culture of the school. 26 of the academic staff are SJI alumni who have returned to teach at their alma mater, working in association with other teachers to preserve and pass on SJI traditions and culture.

  

La Salle Brother **Paul Ho** is Brother-President at SJI, who ensures the Lasallian identity and ethos of the school are preserved. Our lay chaplaincy team takes care of the Catholic needs of the school community.
