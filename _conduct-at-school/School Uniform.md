The school uniform is an important means by which a student expresses his/her belonging and pride in his/her school. The wearing of the correct school uniform, therefore, should be an important concern for every student. Each student in SJI is a walking advertisement for the school each time he/she dons the school uniform and appears in public as a part of this school's family.

The wearing of what is deemed to be correct also requires a certain self-discipline. If one is lazy, then it will be reflected in the cleanliness of his/her shoes or the dirty and untidy state of his/her attire, or his/her unkempt hair. If a person does not care what others think then he/she will give scant regard for his/her appearance. In that context, his/her poor ability to conform with the school dress code reflects not only on him/her but on the school of which he/she is but a small part.

There is also considerable pressure exerted on young people in today's society to keep up with the trends. Designer labels are sometimes perceived as essential, regardless of the price. Hair styles change with the seasons and some young people have a constant urge to have the latest, regardless of the charges of the hairdresser.

Our school represents a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds and a simple school uniform is one way in ensuring unity so that no student will be singled out because of his/her financial inability to keep up with everyone else. For this reason, we do NOT permit certain styles and colours of footwear, styles of shirts or blouses, styles of pants or skirts, and styles of haircut. Conformity is of no great value in itself. If it breeds unity, and avoids distinctions, then it becomes very important for what it does. Uniform, in that context, becomes an important means to an end.

Our expectations are therefore set down clearly in the following guidelines and for every student who loves this school, and all the values it espouses, to wear the uniform correctly and with pride.

We invite you all to familiarise yourself carefully with these guidelines. Ignorance cannot be presented as a reason for one's failure to observe the requirements of the school in regard to uniform.
