**In keeping with the SJI Mission and motto (Ora et Labora), the school encourages an environment that nurtures both prayer and hard work.**

All Catholic teachers and students are expected to participate in the liturgical observances and prayer services that form the rhythm of school-life and that give expression to the Catholic tradition of the school. This includes Morning Prayer in the chapel, prayers at Morning Assembly, prayers before and after meals, prayers before competitions and examinations, Prayer Services and Eucharistic celebrations that form part of the observance of the Inaugural Assembly, Founder’s Day, Lunar New Year celebration, National Day commemoration, Teachers’ Day, Speech and Graduation Ceremony, Farewell Assembly and Thanksgiving Assembly; as well as the Eucharistic liturgies in school that keep the observance of the Holy Days of Obligation of the Catholic Church.

Non-Catholic teachers and students are welcomed but not required to participate in any of the Catholic practices/beliefs during common activities such as morning assembly. If non-Catholics choose to opt out of these common practices/beliefs, the school only expects them either to reflect in their own way or to maintain a respectful silence while others are participating in the practices/beliefs.

Every morning, Morning Prayer in the School Chapel commences at 7:15a.m. All are welcome. As part of Catholic education, all Secondary 1 Catholic students are expected to attend Chapel Morning Prayer daily.

The school day should ordinarily begin and end in prayer. If there is no assembly at the start of the school day, then there should be prayer at the beginning of the first lesson of the day. It is the responsibility of the teacher and the class committee to ensure that a respectful attitude is maintained during prayer.
