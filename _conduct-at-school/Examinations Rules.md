Academic Honesty is based on respect for others and for yourself. You have a responsibility to acknowledge any material which is not your own and you need to be aware that there are serious consequences if you fail to do this. Academic Malpractice includes such things as cheating, collusion and plagiarism and any other form of academic malpractice. Cheating is using a source or work belonging to someone else. “Borrowing” someone else’s work and presenting as your own is cheating. Using forbidden materials in an examination is also cheating. An example of collusion would be working as part of a group but presenting the findings of the group as solely your own. Allowing your work to be copied by someone else is also an example of collusion. Plagiarism is probably the most serious form of academic malpractice. This is the representation of the ideas or work of another person as your own. In all cases work must be appropriately acknowledged. In all cases, we rely on your integrity and honesty and ultimately your respect for yourself to make sure that you are acting as a principled student of SJI.

**SJI TREATS CHEATING, PLAGIARISM AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF ACADEMIC DISHONESY SERIOUSLY AND THEY ARE CATEGORISED UNDER THE SERIOUS (CATEGORY TWO) OFFENCE. APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES WILL BE METED OUT ACCORDINGLY.**
