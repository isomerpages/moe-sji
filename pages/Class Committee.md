#### Introduction

The Class Committee plays a very important role in the life of the School. It is one of the important avenues of student leadership in SJI and enables students to participate in the day-to-day running of the school.

#### Rationale

The Class Committee enables more students to participate in the management of their class by:

*   exercising the responsibility of maintaining good order in the class and school.
*   organising and leading the class in the various class activities and school functions.
*   co-operating with the Class and Subject Tutors to ensure that lessons run smoothly and maximum learning takes place.
