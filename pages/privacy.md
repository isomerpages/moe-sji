### 3\. Consent

Your express consent will be sought when collecting your Personal Data, for the Purposes, uses and disclosures set out above. There will also be instances where your consent for the collection or use of your Personal Data will necessarily be implied from the circumstances by nature of the task or transaction, including your interaction with us or in the course of signing up for, or accepting, any of our activities, services or products.

  

Where you are supplying the Personal Data of another individual (e.g. information of your child, parent, spouse, and/or employees, etc.), you shall ensure that the individual whose Personal Data is supplied to us has consented to provide us with their Personal Data for the respective purposes, and is informed of and consents to the terms of this PDPA Policy.

  

### 4\. Disclosure

We may use and disclose your Personal Data within SJI, and with and to third parties.

  

SJI will not disclose any Personal Data to any third party, unless required or permitted by the PDPA or by law or otherwise needed in connection with legal proceedings or unless we have received your consent.

  

Notwithstanding the above, please note that SJI may disclose any Personal Data to third parties without first obtaining your consent in certain situations including, but not limited to the following:-

a) Cases in which the purpose of the disclosure is clearly in your interests, and if consent cannot be obtained in a timely manner;

b) Cases in which the disclosure is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of yourself or another individual;

c) Cases in which the disclosure is necessary to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights, or to obtain legal services; and

d) Cases in which the disclosure is to a public agency and such disclosure is necessary in the public interest.

  

The above instances of when SJI may disclose your Personal Data are not intended to be exhaustive by any means. However, where SJI discloses your Personal Data to any third parties with your consent, we will employ our best efforts to require such third parties to adhere to the requirements of the PDPA in receiving, processing, using and storing your Personal Data.

  

Apart from your Personal Data, SJI may disclose to carefully chosen third parties navigational and transactional information in the form of **anonymous**, aggregate usage statistics (including "page views" on this website and the products herein) and demographics but only in forms that do not reveal the user's identity or any User Information, except as required by law, as needed in connection with legal proceedings, or unless we have received your consent.

  

### 5\. Access, Corrections & Withdrawal of Consent

You may request to access and/or correct your Personal Data, or have the option to withdraw your consent for the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data for the Purposes currently in our possession or control by submitting a written request to us.

  

We will require sufficient personal information from you in order to ascertain your identity as well as the nature of your request in respect of your Personal Data in order to address your request adequately. Such written requests to access and/or correct or to withdraw should be sent to: [contact@sji.edu.sg](mailto:contact@sji.edu.sg).

  

Once we receive a written request, we will endeavour to address your written request within a reasonable period. Where we are unable to respond to your written request within such time, we will notify you accordingly.

  

Where your Personal Data is corrected please note that we will send your corrected User information to every other organisation to which your Personal Data had been disclosed by SJI within a year prior to the making of the correction by SJI, unless that organisation does not need the corrected Personal Data for any legal or business purpose.

  

In the case of withdrawal of your consent, please note that your withdrawal could result in certain consequences arising from such a withdrawal - for example, it may mean that SJI may not be able to continue its communications or relationship with you.
