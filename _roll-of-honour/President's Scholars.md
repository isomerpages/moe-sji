In 1966, the **Yang Di-pertuan Negara Scholarship** was re-named the **President's scholarship**. In the early 1900s, the **Queen's scholarship** was awarded to top students to study at universities in the UK. In 1959, the Queen's scholarship was replaced by the Singapore **State Scholarship** when Singapore achieved self-governance.
