International Education is integral in today’s education to provide students with international mindedness, see the world, and gain the internationalization experience so vital in today’s borderless and interconnected world. International Education seeks to enable Lasallian educators to internationalize students through meaningful overseas exchanges and service-learning that are age-appropriate.

  

Overseas exchanges are opportunities for interaction between Josephians and their overseas counterparts and may include virtual collaborations, school immersion programmes and student exchange programmes with a cultural focus. Underpinning the overseas exchanges is the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a universal and holistic agenda that aim to create more prosperous and inclusive societies by 2030, which is in line with the ethos and mission of the school.

  

In line with the Lasallian heritage of the school, International Education in SJI bears the hallmarks of a Lasallian school with service being a focus. The school seeks partners that will allow Josephians to make a difference in the lives of others especially the last, the lost and the least, with a preferential option for the poor.

#### International Experience Programme for Year 3 Students

IE for Year 3s seeks to deepen in Josephians the 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities. It also exposes students to Asia with a greater focus on ASEAN countries and sensitises them to Singapore's place in the world and strengthens their commitment and rootedness to Singapore.&nbsp;

  

#### Global Education Programme (GEP) for Year 5 IB students

GEP provides Year 5 Josephians with opportunities for physical challenges, cultural engagement and community service outside Singapore. The aim is for students to acquire the knowledge base and understanding of global issues and develop skills to take action towards creating a better world. The programme embraces both SJI and IB’s vision of developing caring global citizens who will be a catalyst for change and to make a difference to the world.

  

In addition, the GEP leverages on the innovative programmes and dynamic learning environments which the IB programme offers for an easy and effective alignment to SDGs challenging Josephians to make a significant impact on the SDGs. Through the&nbsp;[**Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS)**](/programmes/academic-programmes/ib-diploma-programme/creativity-activity-service)&nbsp;programme, students are challenged to make a difference in the lives of others.
