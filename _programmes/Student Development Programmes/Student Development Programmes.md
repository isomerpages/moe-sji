The SJI Education aims to form the Josephian – a Person of Integrity and a Person for Others – a person who lives life such that the world becomes better because of him or her.

  

A Person of Integrity is principled, reflective, thinks critically and is self-directed.

  

A Person for Others is people-centred, builds community, leads through service and communicates effectively. In order to fulfil the mission of building a better world, the Josephian must be driven by faith and driven by passion.

  

SJI adopts the Learn-Live-Lead approach to develop Josephians through a number of student development platforms.
