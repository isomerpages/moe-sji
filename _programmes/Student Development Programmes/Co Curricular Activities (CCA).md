In keeping with its Mission, Vision and Values, SJI recognises Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) as an integral part of the school curriculum. The CCAs complement the academic programme.

CCAs play an important part in the all-round development of each boy and enable him to actively participate in the life of the school community. These activities promote service, teamwork, leadership, group and self-discipline, loyalty, healthy living and sportsmanship.

Every Josephian is expected to develop and use his talents for his personal development, as well as for the service of his school and the wider community. Therefore, the allocation of CCA is based on the following factors:

1.  student’s talent,
2.  school needs and the availability of places,
3.  student’s interest and
4.  the possibility of the student getting a good CCA grade.

Every Josephian is expected to fulfil a minimum level of participation in the CCA of the school as spelt out in the CCA guidelines. Student involvement is monitored and reported as part of the regular and formal reporting to parents on the progress of their son so that a healthy balance between studies and co-curricular activities is established and maintained for all students.

All non-swimmers in Sec 1 and new students in Sec 2 and Sec 3 will go for Swimming Proficiency at the beginning of the year.

#### CCA Guidelines

Each student is expected to keep to his chosen CCA for his four years of secondary school.  
  
The family and the school must encourage each student to commit himself to his chosen CCA and balance this with his studies. Not every boy can achieve a Distinction ‘A’ grade in CCA but all are expected to give their best in whatever CCA they pursue.

The MOE CCA Grading Scheme known as LEAPS, takes into account the diverse CCA programmes offered by the school as well as the nature and level of students’ participation.

This revised scheme will award students CCA points in five categories:

**Leadership**: Position of responsibility held in a Core CCA and in any other activity. Prior permission is necessary for a second CCA.

**Enrichment**: This will take into account the Student Development Programme, comprising: RME, PSE, Outdoors Education and Aesthetics.

**Achievement**: This will comprise the following three categories:

*   Representation (representing the school at inter-school competitions and SYF Central Judging as well as representing an external organisation in inter-school, regional or international competitions).
*   Attainment (attaining awards of a non-competitive nature, e.g. NYAA)
*   Accomplishment (winning awards at intra-school, national, regional or international competitions).

**Participation**: This reflects the minimum of 75% attendance each year of his membership in his Core CCA. Every boy must be a member of a school-based CCA.

**Service**: In keeping with the Lasallian ethos of the school which encourages each student to be ‘a man for others’ and the national policy of greater community involvement.
