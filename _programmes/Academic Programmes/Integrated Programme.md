The SJI Integrated Programme (IP) leading to the [**IB Diploma**](/programmes/academic-programmes/ib-diploma-programme) aims to empower young people to deal with the complexity, diversity and rapid changes living in today’s globalized world.

  

This is achieved through an inter-disciplinary approach that centres on 3 processes, Core, Apply and Integrate.

It describes a student as moving from core content, skills and disposition aligned to IBDP knowledge, to application in the real world, and eventually integrating their knowledge to create purposeful connections between learning and doing for effective leading and service. It also provides opportunities for in-depth study in an area of talent and discovery of new areas of interest.
