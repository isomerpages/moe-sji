We believe that it is very important for our students to learn how to learn. While the students are prepared well for the national examinations, we also help them to build a strong capacity for inquiry and thinking so that they can continue to learn even after leaving school.

SJI offers a [dual track education](/programmes/overview-of-sji-education) comprising a [6-year Integrated Programme (IP) track](/programmes/academic-programmes/integrated-programme) and a [4-year O-level Programme (OP) track](/programmes/academic-programmes/o-level-programme).

  

The 6-year IP track comprises 4 years of secondary education integrated with 2 years of the [International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP)](/programmes/academic-programmes/ib-diploma-programme) at the JC level. These IP students will complete 4 years of secondary education and will through-train on to the IBDP at JC level without the need to sit for the O-level examinations.

  

Students on the 4-year O-level track will complete their secondary education by sitting for the GCE 'O' level examinations. Based on their O-level results, the O-level students could apply to continue their JC education in SJI.

  

The Josephian academic programme provides a broad-based academic curriculum. At the upper secondary level, we give our O-level boys one of the most broad-based subject options among secondary schools in Singapore. The boys take between 7 and 9 subjects for the GCE 'O' level examinations. Most boys offer at least 2 Sciences, 2 Mathematics, 2 Humanities and 2 Languages. More than half of our boys offer triple Sciences - Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

  

We strongly believe in this broad-based academic curriculum as it provides our students with a strong foundation to pursue any course of study or discipline in the future.

  

Also, a more broad-based education is necessary for today's innovation-driven economy as the latter calls for the ability to understand and draw from different disciplines and to address problems and opportunities from a wide range of perspectives.
