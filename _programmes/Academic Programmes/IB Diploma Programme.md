Founded by De La Salle Brothers in 1852, St. Joseph’s Institution (SJI) is an independent Catholic school, whose mission is to nurture students to learn how to learn and to learn how to live, so that they can be empowered to grow into men and women of integrity and men and women for others.

  

St. John Baptist De La Salle, the founder of the De La Salle schools, pioneered a progressive education system more than 300 years ago.

  

Today, SJI continues that spirit of education following the mission and supporting innovative education. In addition to secondary school education for boys, **SJI offers pre-university education for both boys and girls with the [International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP)](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/)**\*.

  

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, as an alternative to the GCE ‘A’ Levels, is recognized for admission to all Singapore universities and leading universities globally. It is valued for its holistic curriculum and strong focus on independent learning and thinking for university studies, the workplace and the all-round development of young people for a fulfilling life.

  

Its strong emphasis on internationalism, intercultural understanding and making a positive difference to the world fits well with the mission of SJI. The IBDP also empowers Josephians to address the complexity and diversity of a rapidly changing world to become youth with a global outlook, while remaining strongly rooted in faith, values, culture and community.

  

Our hope for each young person is to achieve academic excellence, to gain an enriching transformative educational experience that will allow them to become true global citizens, and ultimately, to be a catalyst for change and never lose sight of the last, the lost and the least. SJI is committed to providing high quality education in the true spirit of the IBDP, and according to the ethos and values of Lasallian education.

  

SJI offers the IBDP in three distinguishing but interlinking elements: **[Academic: the SJI Approach](/programmes/academic-programmes/ib-diploma-programme/programme-overview#_ptoh_46443)**, **[Holistic Development: the SJI Way of life](/programmes/academic-programmes/ib-diploma-programme/programme-overview#_ptoh_51086)**, and **[Character: the SJI Difference](/programmes/academic-programmes/ib-diploma-programme/programme-overview#_ptoh_51087)**. These three elements provide a holistic learning experience and varied platforms to engage our students, on their journey of lifelong learning.
