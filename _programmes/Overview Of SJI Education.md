SJI offers its secondary school boys a [dual track education](/programmes/overview-of-sji-education#_ptoh_88517) comprising an [Integrated Programme (IP)](/programmes/academic-programmes/integrated-programme) and an [‘O’ Level programme (OP)](/programmes/academic-programmes/o-level-programme). The IP track is a 6-year programme comprising of 4 years of secondary education integrated with 2 years of the [International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP)](/programmes/academic-programmes/ib-diploma-programme) in Years 5 and 6. The 2-year pre-university IBDP admits boys and girls (co-education). The ‘O’ Level track is a 4-year programme leading to the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations at the end of Year 4. Based on their O-level examination results, they can apply to continue the IBDP at SJI, or pursue courses at other junior colleges or polytechnics.

  

An SJI education aims to educate the **whole person**. At SJI, we focus on [nurturing our students to learn how to learn and to learn how to live](/about-sji/mission-vision-and-values), so that they can be empowered to grow into [Men and Women of Integrity and Men and Women for Others](/programmes/profile-of-a-josephian). We operate based on the values of **Faith** as our foundation, **Service** as our way, and **Community** as our support.

  

Hence, our broad-based academic curriculum integrated with a comprehensive student development curriculum focus on providing a balanced and holistic education with a strong emphasis on [character formation and leadership development](/programmes/overview-of-sji-education#_ptoh_45537). We develop each boy according to his talent and interest, to prepare him for the real world beyond school. We not only want our students to acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and dispositions that will prepare them well for post-secondary education and the future but also to be able to live a meaningful life driven by passion in the service for others.
