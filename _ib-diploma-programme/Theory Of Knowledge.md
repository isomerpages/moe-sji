TOK plays a special role in the IB as it provides an opportunity for students to reflect on the nature of knowledge and the connections between areas of academic knowledge that they study and link it to themselves as a ‘’knower’ in a way that they can be aware of their own perspectives and those of others. The TOK course is centrally focused on developing skills of critical thinking by getting students to interrogate knowledge construction processes and unpack commonly held assumptions. Students are evaluated on two final assessment tasks: at the end of Year 5, students are to create a TOK exhibition and in Year 6, complete a 1600-word essay based on a prescribed title.
