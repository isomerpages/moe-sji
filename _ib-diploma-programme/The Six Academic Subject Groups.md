##### **a) English A: Literature**

Literature is a course concerned with the exploration of our conceptions, interpretations and experiences of the world. It enables the exploration of one of the more enduring areas of human creativity and in so doing it encourages independent, critical and clear thinking. It encourages personal growth and respect for the imagination, and a perceptive approach to the understanding and interpretation of a variety of literary works. A selection of literary texts will be read and studied in preparation for the IB examinations, consisting of Paper 1 (the Unseen), Paper 2 (Comparative Essay), the Individual Oral (engaging global issues across texts) and a Research Essay for HL students only.

##### **b) English A: Language and Literature**

“The Language and Literature course aims to prepare students to be capable critics and savvy consumers of the role of language in our lives. It roughly divides attention between traditional literary works and a variety of other language texts, with the aim of exploring how language can be used and manipulated.” (Oxford Companion) The course has two key unique foci – one is the construction of meaning of texts and how meaning, whether personal, social or political, is produced in language. The other key aspect is the interplay between context, producer, text and consumer, and the manner in which these interact to create meaning. A selection of literary and non-literary texts will be read and studied in preparation for the IB examinations, consisting of Paper 1 (the Unseen), Paper 2 (Comparative Essay), the Individual Oral (engaging global issues across texts) and a Research Essay for HL students only.

##### **c) Chinese A: Literature (SL)**

<u>Prerequisite: Teacher recommendation</u>

The Language A literature course should be taken in the student's best language. The focus is to develop skills in both critical reading and textual analysis of literary works. At Chinese A Standard Level, students study 10 works of literature. Texts studied include poetry, drama, short stories and novels originally written in Chinese as well as literature in translation. In the literature section of the exam, students are required to demonstrate mastery of the analysis techniques for poetry and drama works, comment on the writing and expression techniques used in Chinese and Foreign Literature, and have a thorough understanding of the text types and terminologies. For the cultural part, students need to display up to date cultural knowledge, decode the expression techniques and cross-cultural meanings behind the text and images, and make use of their creativity to express how they understand the nature of society.

_^ Group 2 -_

1.  _MOE Bilingual Policy requires students taking NTIL or any MTL-in-lieu to do this in addition to the IBDP requirements._
2.  _WEF 2019, SJI will replace the O-Level MTL & HMTL (Higher Mother Tongue Language) examinations with school-based examinations for SJI's IP students._

  

To earn an IB Diploma, a candidate must study an additional language, though a second Language A may be taken instead of studying that language as a Group 2 subject.

All group 2 subjects promote a vision of learning in which the development of language skills and conceptual understandings of language are complementary to each other. Students will become more accomplished communicators in the languages they study when their abilities to read, write and speak about course content are reinforced and extended by an understanding of the why and how people use language to communicate.

**Language Ab Initio** courses are for beginners (that is, students who have little or no previous experience of learning the language they have chosen). These courses are only available at standard level. Such a course focuses on giving the student basic knowledge of both the language in everyday use and the culture of the places where it is spoken. Students will develop an awareness of the relationship between language and culture. Their appreciation of different cultural perspectives will be enhanced by studying this course, thereby promoting internationalism. The standard reached by the student after two years is considerably lower than that reached in language B. For students to achieve communicative competence in a variety of situations, the following prescribed themes are explored in the Language Ab Initio course: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organisation, sharing the planet. The language skills that are taught and assessed are: listening, reading, writing, speaking and cultural awareness.

**Language B** courses are intended for students who have had previous experience in learning the language. These courses further develop students’ ability to communicate in the language through the study of language, themes and texts. In doing so, they also develop conceptual understandings of how language works. Language B courses may be studied at either higher level or standard level.

**SL**: Students will learn to communicate in the target language in familiar and unfamiliar contexts. They will describe situations, narrate events, make comparisons, explain problems, and state and support their personal opinions on a variety of topics relating to the prescribed themes of identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organisation, sharing the planet. The course aims to help students understand the importance of communication in the modern world and equip them with the communication skills necessary to incorporate the language into their lifestyle or work after school and university.

**HL**: In addition to the requirements of the SL course, HL students are expected to extend the range and complexity of the language they use and understand in order to communicate. They should also be keen to develop an understanding of the fundamental elements of literary texts such as theme, plot and character. The course is for students who are considering further study of the language at the university level or in their future careers.

* * *

 #### Group 3: Individuals & Societies

Students are expected to choose one of the following courses at either Higher Level (HL) or Standard Level (SL):

*   **Economics** \- HL / SL
*   **History** \- HL / SL
*   **Geography** \- HL / SL

  

These courses encourage the development of a critical appreciation of:

*   human experience and behaviour
*   the varieties of physical, economic and social environments that people inhabit
*   the history of social and cultural institutions.

  

Each course is designed to foster in students the capacity to identify, analyse critically and evaluate theories, concepts and arguments relating to the nature and activities of individuals and societies.

  

The courses in Group 3 have no formal requirements; prior experience with history or geography at the secondary level are also not necessary. However, a strong passion for the subject and a critical and curious mindset would be appreciated.

  

##### **a) Economics**

An exciting and dynamic subject, the DP economics course allows students to develop an understanding of the complexities & interdependence of economic activities in a rapidly changing world. The problem of scarcity is central to economic theory. Due to this, choices have to be made. At both SL and HL levels, students examine economic theories, models and key concepts and apply them through examining 6 real-world issues. The 9 concepts underpinning the economics course are scarcity, choice, efficiency, equity, economic well-being, sustainability, change, interdependence and intervention. Students of this course will develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to act responsibly as global citizens.

  

##### **b) History**

History is more than a study of the past. Using a comparative and multi-perspective approach, the DP History course is a world history course, which not only involves the study of a variety of history (political, economic, social & cultural) but also provides a balance of structure and flexibility. In addition to gaining factual knowledge, students are encouraged to think historically and to develop historical skills, critical thinking & an understanding of the multiple interpretations of history. The 6 concepts that feature strongly for the DP History course include change, continuity, causation, consequence, significance and perspectives.

  

##### **c) Geography**

A dynamic subject that lies between social or human sciences and natural science, the DP Geography course examines the interactions between individuals, societies and physical processes in both time and space. Trends and patterns of these interactions are of special interest. Students will investigate how people adapt and respond to change and evaluate the management strategies associated with these changes. They are also encouraged to explain the similarities and differences between different places, on a variety of scales and from different perspectives. Distinct in its spatial dimension, this course integrates environmental, human and physical geography and examines concepts and ideas from a wide variety of disciplines. As such, students acquire aspects of both socio-economic and scientific methodologies, develop life skills and an appreciation and respect for alternative ideas, approaches and viewpoints.

  

* * *

  
#### Group 4: Sciences

All science courses in the IBDP share a common structure. Each comprises of four parts over the 2 years:

*   core topics (95 hours) that are studied at both Higher Level (HL) and Standard Level (SL),
*   additional higher level (AHL) topics (60 hours) that are taken at HL only,
*   one option which comprises core topics (both HL and SL - 15 hours) and additional higher level topics (HL only - 10 hours).
*   practical scheme of work (60 hours for HL and 40 hours for SL) which comprises practical activities, individual investigation (internal assessment - IA) and Group 4 project.

All students take part in the group 4 project which is an interdisciplinary activity in which all Diploma Programme science students must participate. The intention is that students from the different group 4 subjects analyse a common topic or problem. The exercise is a collaborative experience where the emphasis is on the processes involved in, rather than the products of, such an activity.

  

The assessment structure is the same for all sciences. External assessment (exams) at the end of the course contribute 80% of the final mark. The remaining 20% is based on the internal assessment.

  
<u>Previous Knowledge</u>

The distinction between SL and HL is one of breadth and depth. To take a science at HL, previous exposure to the specific group 4 subject would be necessary at O-Level or IP Year 4. For Chemistry HL and Physics HL, it is expected that students are at least taking Mathematics SL. At SL, previous knowledge of the specific science subject is helpful but not essential.

##### **a) Biology**

In Biology, you will study the science of living things and how they function. The Core includes Cells, Genetics, Ecology and Human Physiology. The additional material takes these further, and adds some more, such as Plant Science, and Defence Against Disease. Linking themes are Structure and Function; Universality versus Diversity; Equilibrium within Systems; and Evolution. The option offered is Human Physiology.

##### **b) Chemistry**

In Chemistry, you will study materials, and the conversion of substances from one to another. Core and Additional Higher level: material covered here includes such important topics as Stoichiometry; Atomic Structure; Chemical Bonding and Structure; Periodicity; Energetics; Chemical kinetics; Equilibrium; Acids and Bases; Redox Processes; and Organic Chemistry. The option offered is Medicinal Chemistry.

##### **c) Physics**

In Physics, you will study the properties and interactions of matter and energy. Core and Additional Higher level: these introduce the central concepts of Mechanics; Atomic and Nuclear Physics; Waves; Thermal Physics; Electricity and Magnetism. The option offered is Astrophysics.

* * *

  
#### Group 5: Mathematics

From 2020, SJI will offer the new IB Maths Analysis and Approaches (MAA) courses at Higher and Standard level for the first examination at SJI in November 2021. In the MAA courses, there is an emphasis on calculus, algebraic, graphical and numerical approaches, which are areas familiar to IP and O-Level students. There will be some consideration of mathematical proof in both the MAA HL and SL courses that will be new to most students. Dependant on the mathematical pre-requisites of different university courses, the MAA courses will also be recognised for entry to university courses in Singapore and in other countries throughout the world such as the UK, US and Australia.

The content of the MAA SL course will be a subset of the MAA HL course. However, the MAA HL and SL courses will cater to the different needs, interests and abilities of students. The MAA HL and SL courses will consequently be taught with a different emphasis, depth and pace at SJI. Therefore, great care should be taken to select the course that is most appropriate for an individual student. In making this selection, individual students should be advised to take account of factors such as their own ability in mathematics, as well as their plans for university or intended career paths.

The assessment of the respective MAA courses comprises external assessment in the form of written examination papers (80%) which will involve some questions common to the HL and SL courses, and a coursework component (20%) called the Internal Assessment (IA). The final assessment of the Internal Assessment is slightly different for each course. However, the Internal Assessment process for students in both courses will include an extended period of mathematical exploration involving mathematical investigation or mathematical modelling in an area of a student’s own interest. During lessons, students will be provided with a toolkit of skills required to tackle the IA in mathematics effectively. An overview of the assessment components of each MAA course is given below:

<u>Previous Knowledge</u>

The Visual Arts course is designed to offer students the opportunity to build on prior experience while encouraging them to develop and use new skills, techniques and ideas. While it is possible to take the course without previous experience, this is helpful, particularly at HL option A (HLA).

  

##### **b) Music**

The Diploma Programme music course provides an appropriate foundation for further study in music at the university level or in music career pathways, and also provides all students with the opportunity to engage in the world of music as lifelong participants. All students will engage in exploring and experimenting with music in and of varied contexts. Through practical engagement in musical activities as researchers, performers and creators, students learn to communicate critical and artistic intentions and purpose.

HL students offer an additional collaborative project component based on real-life practices of music-making where they take up musical leadership to plan, and collaboratively realise.

<u>Previous Knowledge</u>

While prior music experience is not mandatory at SL, it is recommended.

Prior music experience is very strongly recommended at HL.

The annual Year 6 Grad Show presents the works by the visual art and music students from the graduating IBDP class. Their artistic works and original compositions were presented to the SJI community in the Bunker. This video showcases the creative works as explained by the student artists from Class of 2022:
